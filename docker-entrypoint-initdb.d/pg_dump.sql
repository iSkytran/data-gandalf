332	sports	Countries Olympics Medals since 1896 	The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are the leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are normally held every four years, and since 1994, has alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year period.\n\nA medal ceremony is held after the conclusion of each Olympic event. The winner, and the second- and third-place competitors or teams, stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals by a member of the IOC. After the medals have been received, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country is played. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, assisting the officials who present the medals and acting as flag-bearers. In the Summer Olympics, each medal ceremony is held at the venue where the event has taken place, but the ceremonies at the Winter Olympics are usually held in a special "plaza". 	kaggle	{"water sports",global,sports,"exploratory data analysis","data visualization"}	{CC-BY-SA-3.0}	{"countries ","ioc_code ",summer_participations,summer_gold,summer_silver,summer_bronze,summer_total,winter_participations,winter_gold,winter_silver,winter_bronze,winter_total,total_participation,total_gold,total_silver,total_bronze,"total_total "}	156	17	2652	0	1

337	sports	Independence and Interdependence in Sports	### Context\n\nThis is the dataset I created for my Bachelor's thesis in Sports Sciences. The purpose was finding differences in the self-construal (indepence vs interdependence) of people practicing team, individual and trend sports. \nI used an online questionnaire to gather the data. Self-construal was accessed using the Self-Construal-Scale (Singelis, 1994). This scale evaluates participants independence (from other people) and their interdepence (with other people) with 12 questions each. Apart from that, each participant had to identify their most important sport and how they perform it.\n\n### Content\n\nWhat's inside is more than just rows and columns. Make it easy for others to get started by describing how you acquired the data and what time period it represents, too.\n\n- **index** - number of completed questionnaire\n- **importance** - How important is sport for you? Scale 1-7\n- **sport** - With which sport do you identify the most?\n- **frequency** - How often do you practise any sport? Scale 1-8, 1 being less than once a week, 2 once a week, ..., 8 every day\n- **how_alone** - How do you prefer practising? Alone?\n- **how_small_groups** - How do you prefer practising? In small groups?\n- **how_big_groups** - How do you prefer practising? In big groups?\n- **independence** - mean value for independence from 1 to 7 (7 means highest independence)\n- **interdependence** - mean value for interdependence from 1 to 7 (7 means highest interdependence)\n- **sex** - gender of participant\n- **age** - age of participant\n- **education** - highest degree of education, scale 1-9\n\n### Inspiration\n\n- How do athletes from different sports differ in their independence/interdependence?\n- Are there differences according to gender, age, education or how they perform sports?\n- Is it sensible to group the athletes into team, individual and trend sports oder do you find a better classification?\n\nThis was the abstract of my thesis (Feld, 2014). Maybe you can also try to reconstruct the findings or try finding more interesting facts.\n\n&gt; Team, individual and trend sport athletes were compared to find differences in in-\ndependence and interdependence. Male and female athletes‘ results were evaluat-\ned seperatly from each other. The athletes had to complete a survey about their\nsport behavior including their most important sports and the Self-Construal-Scale to\nclassify them into their group and to obtain an individual score on each independ-\nence and interdependence. Differences were found in both independence and in-\nterdependence. Team sport athletes scored higher in independence than individual\nsport athletes. Trend sport athletes reached a higher score for interdependence\ncompared to the other athletes. Female trend sport athletes also proved to have a\nhigher interdependence than the other female groups. Furthermore, the study iden-\n1tified female athletes as more independent and less interdependent than male ath-\nletes. Other significant differences could not be found. However, a subsequent\nmoderation analysis showed that there exists a positive correlation between inter-\ndependence and importance of sports.\n\n### References\n\nFeld, H. (2014).

346	sports	Sports10 Data	### Sports10 Dataset\nA new dataset containing 100,000 Gameplay Images of 175 Video Games across 10 Sports Genres. The games are also divided into three visual styling categories: RETRO (arcade-style, the 1990s and earlier), MODERN (roughly 2000s) and PHOTOREAL (roughly late 2010s). Representing games through their pixels offers a promising approach for building general-purpose and versatile game models. While games are not merely images, neural network models trained on game pixels often capture differences of the visual style of the image rather than the content of the game. As a result, such models cannot generalize well even within similar games of the same genre.  The findings of this data bring us closer to universal visual encoders for games that can be reused across previously unseen games without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.\n\n### Dataset Preview\n![Dataset Preview](https://github.com/ChintanTrivedi/contrastive-game-representations/blob/master/datasets/Sports10%20Dataset%20Preview.png?raw=true)\n\n### If you find this dataset useful, please consider upvoting ❤️	kaggle	{games,"video games",sports,internet,"mobile and wireless"}	{copyright-authors}	{Genre,PublishYear,GameName,NumImages,FolderName,GameGeneration,Fold,VideoLink}	175	8	1400	0	0.9411764705882353

The data is from the Federal Election Commission and OpenSecrets.\n\n**Columns - Owner, Team, League, Recipient, Amount, Election Year, Party**\n\nIf you need additional inspiration, check out this article by FiveThirtyEight to have a better understanding of the scenario.\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/inside-the-political-donation-history-of-wealthy-sports-owners/\n\n### DO UPVOTE!	kaggle	{sports,politics,"exploratory data analysis","data visualization","data analytics"}	{CC0-1.0}	{Owner,Team,League,Recipient,Amount,"Election Year",Party}	2798	7	19586	9	1
343	sports	Pro and College Sports Lines	### Context\n\nAfter participating in many Kaggle competitions, we decided to open-source our Python AutoML framework [AlphaPy][1]. You can configure models using YAML, and it's a quick way to develop a classification or regression model with any number of [scikit-learn][2] algorithms. More importantly, we needed the ability to easily write custom transformations to engineer features that could be imported by other tools such as [H2O.ai][3] and [DataRobot][4], which are commercial AutoML tools.\n\nWe were very interested in predicting the stock market and sporting events, so we developed some tools for collecting end-of-day stock market data and then transforming that time series data for machine learning. For the sports data, we painstakingly entered game results on a daily basis, and this dataset (albeit limited) is the result. Sports APIs such as [Sportradar][5] are becoming more prevalent, but you still need a pipeline to merge all that data to shape it for machine learning.\n\n### Content\n\nWe collected game results, line, and over/under data for the following sports and seasons:\n\n - NFL 2014, 2015 (2 Seasons)\n - NBA 2015-16 (1 Season)\n - NCAA Football 2015-16 (1 Season)\n - NCAA Basketball 2015-16 (1 Season)\n\nUsing AlphaPy, we developed a sports pipeline to analyze trend data in the game results. You can find [documentation][6] and examples [here][7].\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nEvery speculator's dream is to gain an edge, whether it be betting on sports or speculating on stocks. This dataset is just a small step for applying machine learning to the world of sports data.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/ScottFreeLLC/AlphaPy\n[2]: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/\n[3]: https://www.h2o.ai/\n[4]: https://www.datarobot.com/\n[5]: https://developer.sportradar.com/\n[6]: http://alphapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[7]: http://alphapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/ncaab.html	kaggle	{basketball,sports,"computer science",gambling}	{CC0-1.0}	{season,date,away.team,away.score,home.team,home.score,line,over_under}	6652	32	53216	0	0.6470588235294118

351	sports	Wrestling World Tournament	## Context\n\nA **big wrestling tournament** 🏆 was held this year. The 500 best athletes from three different federations across the globe joined us to compete in one-on-one matches. The pools were made randomly no matter the profile of the athlete.  At the end of the tournament, the wrestlers can be ranked according to their number of victories. \n\nWrestling 🤼 is a hand-to-hand combat system and a set of combat sports involving grappling-type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins and other grappling holds. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into martial arts, combat sports and military systems.\n\n## Content\n\nIn this Dataset, we have information on the different wrestlers such as their gender, weight, height, nationality, but also different scores to measure their strength, agility and mental abilities. More to be added.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThis dataset is ideal for regression trying to predict the final rank of the wrestler for example.\nClassification can also be performed to predict for example the federation, the country, or the sports the wrestler master or clustering between the different wrestlers.\n\nRemember to upvote if you found the dataset useful 🥇 \n\n## Dataset Glossary (Column-Wise)\n\n- **name**: Name of the wrestler.\n- **gender**: Gender of the wrestler.\n- **age**: Age of the wrestler.\n- **height**: Height of the wrestler in cm.\n- **weight**: Weight of the wrestler in kg.\n- **nationality**: Nationality of the wrestler.\n- **sports**: The combat sports mastered by the wrestler.\n- **hours\\_per\\_day**: The number of hours spent a day to work out and practice.\n- **strength**: A strength score given by the federation.

369	housing	California Housing Data (1990)	# Source\n\nThis is the dataset used in this book: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/datasets/housing to illustrate a sample end-to-end ML project workflow (pipeline). This is a great book - I highly recommend!\n\nThe data is based on California Census in 1990.\n\n### About the Data (from the book):\n\n"This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from Luís Torgo's page (University of Porto). Luís Torgo obtained it from the StatLib repository (which is closed now). The dataset may also be downloaded from StatLib mirrors.\n\nThe following is the description from the book author:\n\nThis dataset appeared in a 1997 paper titled Sparse Spatial Autoregressions by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry, published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. They built it using the 1990 California census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).\n\nThe dataset in this directory is almost identical to the original, with two differences: \n207 values were randomly removed from the total_bedrooms column, so we can discuss what to do with missing data.\nAn additional categorical attribute called ocean_proximity was added, indicating (very roughly) whether each block group is near the ocean, near the Bay area, inland or on an island. This allows discussing what to do with categorical data.\nNote that the block groups are called "districts" in the Jupyter notebooks, simply because in some contexts the name "block group" was confusing."\n\n### About the Data (From Luís Torgo page): \nhttp://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/%7Eltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html\n\nThis is a dataset obtained from the StatLib repository. Here is the included description:\n\n"We collected information on the variables using all the block groups in California from the 1990 Cens us. In this sample a block group on average includes 1425.5 individuals living in a geographically co mpact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. W e computed distances among the centroids of each block group as measured in latitude and longitude. W e excluded all the block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables. T he final data contained 20,640 observations on 9 variables. The dependent variable is ln(median house value)."\n\n\n### End-to-End ML Project Steps (Chapter 2 of the book)\n\n1. Look at the big picture \n2. Get the data\n3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights\n4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms\n5. Select a model and train it\n6. Fine-tune your model \n7. Present your solution\n8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system\n\n# The 10-Step Machine Learning Project Workflow (My Version)\n\n1. Define business object\n2. Make sense of the data from a high level\n    - data types (number, text, object, etc.)\n    - continuous/discrete\n    - basic stats (min, max, std, median, etc.) using boxplot\n    - frequency via histogram\n    - scales and distributions of different features\n3. Create the traning and test sets using proper sampling methods, e.g., random vs. stratified\n4. Correlation analysis (pair-wise and attribute combinations)\n5. Data cleaning (missing data, outliers, data errors)\n6. Data transformation via pipelines (categorical text to number using one hot encoding, feature scaling via normalization/standardization, feature combinations)\n7. Train and cross validate different models and select the most promising one (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were tried in this tutorial)\n8. Fine tune the model using trying different combinations of hyperparameters\n9. Evaluate the model with best estimators in the test set\n10.

353	education	Education and COVID-19	### Context\n\nMost governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions in an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese nationwide closures are impacting over 60% of the world’s student population. Several other countries have implemented localized closures impacting millions of additional learners.\n\nIn addition to closing schools, countries are exploring options for remote learning and use of other educational resources to mitigate the loss of learning. This involves capitalizing on work already started and addressing ever-present challenges like degrees of accessibility within communities to ensure equity in access.\n\nSo here is the data of the status of schools around the globe during COVID-19\n\n### Content\n\nThe Dataset contains information about the closure of schools around the globe such as status and date of closing. It also contains the No. of students enrolled in various levels of school around the globe in various countries. Figures correspond to the number of learners enrolled at pre-primary, primary, secondary as well as at tertiary education levels.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to UNESCO Institute for Statistics(UIS) and World Bank for providing this data	kaggle	{education,"primary and secondary schools",covid19}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Country Code","Country Name","Dt Extraction","If Closed due to COVID19 When","Income Level","Region Name","School Status","Year Pre","Year Prm","Year Sec","Year Ter","Latitude (generated)","Longitude (generated)",Enrollment,"Se Pre Enrl","Se Prm Enrl","Se Sec Enrl","Se Ter Enrl"}	200	18	3600	66	1

Understand the market trends and value of positions held within this system to help students prepare for their future career aspirations as well as empower employers with detailed data. This is an essential piece to have when looking into what fair compensation looks like in higher education and obtaining important insight regarding salary negotiation, wage structure, and workforce optimization\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; Welcome to this dataset on wage disparities in Pennsylvania's higher education system! This dataset contains salary information for employees of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) in 2013. You can use this information to uncover trends and differences in pay between different universities, departments, and job positions. \n&gt; \n&gt; Getting Started: \n&gt; - Open the file “2013_Salaries__Pennsylvania_State_System_of_Higher_Education.csv” and explore its contents. This dataset is composed of 8 columns: Name, Base Pay, University or Office, Position, Gender/Race/Ethnicity, Furlough Reduction % Reduction Days Number Total Pay Contract Type Max Probationary Step Payscale Group Admission Type Total Headcount Full-Time Employees Part-time employees and position code. \n&gt; - To begin your analysis you can start by identifying basic statistics about the data such as averages or counts for each column of data you are interested in such as salary range by university or office and job title groups such as deans versus other staff members . \n&gt; - Next identify which universities pay their staff the highest salaries? What kind of differences do you see across schools? Once you have identified key trends look into potential differences within each university using gender/race/ethnicity filters to identify wage disparities across demographic groups since unfortunately wage discrepancy still exists today even when controlling for variables like education experience seniority etc \n&gt; - Finally create graphs tables etc that present your findings effectively so that policy makers HR departments other stakeholders have a better insight into what changes need to be implemented so all personnel are treated equally with fair wages regardless of background! Good luck!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyze salary gaps between genders and positions to identify possible pay inequality, and to create true diversity in the workplace.\n&gt; - Track changes in base salaries over time for individual jobs or trends throughout a university/office over years.\n&gt; - Compare average annual salaries across different universities/offices within the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education; this information could be used to help inform decisions about where to work/study for prospective faculty and students alike!\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/education)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: 2013_Salaries__Pennsylvania_State_System_of_Higher_Education.csv**\n| Column name              | Description                                               |\n|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Name**                 | The name of the employee.

370	housing	California Housing Prices Data (5 new features!)	### Similar Datasets:\n\n- Boston House Prices: [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/the-boston-houseprice-data)\n- Gender Pay Gap Dataset: [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/gender-pay-gap-dataset)\n- Company Bankruptcy Prediction: [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction)\n- Spanish Wine Quality Dataset: [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/spanish-wine-quality-dataset)\n\n\n### Context\n\nThis is the dataset is a modified version of the California Housing Data used in the paper `Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. "Sparse spatial autoregressions." Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.`. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being too toyish and too cumbersome.\n\nThe data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.\n\n\n### Modifications with respect to the original data\n\nThis dataset includes 5 extra features defined by me: "Distance to coast", "Distance to Los Angeles", "Distance to San Diego", "Distance to San Jose", and "Distance to San Francisco". These extra features try to account for the distance to the nearest coast and the distance to the centre of the largest cities in California.\n\nThe distances were calculated using the Haversine formula with the Longitude and Latitude:\n\n![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a65dbbde43ff45bacd2505fcf32b44fc7dcd8cc0)\n\nwhere:\n\n- `phi_1` and `phi_2` are the Latitudes of point 1 and point 2, respectively\n- `lambda_1` and `lambda_2` are the Longitudes of point 1 and point 2, respectively\n- `r` is the radius of the Earth (6371km)\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data.

It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.\n\nThe data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.\n  \n### Content\n\nThe data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data.

360	education	Inequality in Education Around the World	### Context\n\nIn today's interconnected world, the issue of inequality in education stands as a stark reminder of the disparities that persist across countries and communities. While strides have been made to improve access to education, a significant proportion of children still lack the opportunity to learn, particularly in low-income and conflict-affected regions. Quality of education also diverges, with well-equipped schools in affluent areas contrasting with under-resourced institutions in marginalized settings. Gender inequality further compounds the problem, as cultural norms and economic factors often impede girls' education in certain societies. Tackling inequality in education isn't just a matter of fairness; it's a critical step towards building equitable societies and empowering individuals to contribute meaningfully to their own development and that of their nations.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains historical data covering a range of indicators pertaining to educational inequality on a global scale. The dataset's prominent components include: ISO3, Country, Human Development Groups, UNDP Developing Regions, HDI Rank (2021), and Inequality in Education spanning the years 2010 to 2021.\n\n### Dataset Glossary (Column-wise)\n\n* <b>ISO3</b> - ISO3 for the Country/Territory\n* <b>Country</b> - Name of the Country/Territory\n* <b>Human Development Groups</b> - Human Development Groups\n* <b>UNDP Developing Regions</b> - UNDP Developing Regions\n* <b>HDI Rank (2021)</b> - Human Development Index Rank for 2021\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2010)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2010\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2011)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2011\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2012)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2012\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2013)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2013\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2014)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2014\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2015)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2015\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2016)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2016\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2017)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2017\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2018)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2018\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2019)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2019\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2020)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2020\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2021)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2021\n\n### Data Dictionary\n\n* <b>UNDP Developing Regions</b>:\n - <b>SSA</b> - Sub-Saharan Africa\n - <b>LAC</b> - Latin America and the Caribbean\n - <b>EAP</b> - East Asia and the Pacific\n - <b>AS</b> - Arab States\n - <b>ECA</b> - Europe and Central Asia\n - <b>SA</b> - South Asia\n\n### Structure of the Dataset\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qX5cmUX.png)\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nThis Dataset is created from <b>[Human Development Reports](https://hdr.undp.org/)</b>.

361	education	Lead Scoring X Online Education	### Lead Scoring Case Study - Problem Statement\n\nAn education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. \n\n The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. \n\n \n\nNow, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone. A typical lead conversion process can be represented using the following funnel:\n\n\nLead Conversion Process - Demonstrated as a funnel\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3515295%2Fa031932efdd103c26332798adad58047%2FXNote_201901081613670.jpg?generation=1573575207907385&alt=media)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage (top) but only a few of them come out as paying customers from the bottom. In the middle stage, you need to nurture the potential leads well (i.e. educating the leads about the product, constantly communicating etc. ) in order to get a higher lead conversion.\n\n \n\nX Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.\n\n\n### Content\n\nYou have been provided with a leads dataset from the past with around 9000 data points. This dataset consists of various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. which may or may not be useful in ultimately deciding whether a lead will be converted or not. The target variable, in this case, is the column ‘Converted’ which tells whether a past lead was converted or not wherein 1 means it was converted and 0 means it wasn’t converted. You can learn more about the dataset from the data dictionary provided in the zip folder at the end of the page. Another thing that you also need to check out for are the levels present in the categorical variables. Many of the categorical variables have a level called 'Select' which needs to be handled because it is as good as a null value (think why?).\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis data set is created by UpGrad-IIIT-B and given as part of assignment\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThere are quite a few goals for this case study.\n\nBuild a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.	kaggle	{business,education,"logistic regression",pca}	{other}	{"Prospect ID","Lead Number","Lead Origin","Lead Source","Do Not Email","Do Not Call",Converted,TotalVisits,"Total Time Spent on Website","Page Views Per Visit","Last Activity",Country,Specialization,"How did you hear about X Education","What is your current occupation","What matters most to you in choosing a course",Search,Magazine,"Newspaper Article","X Education Forums",Newspaper,"Digital Advertisement","Through Recommendations","Receive More Updates About Our Courses",Tags,"Lead Quality","Update me on Supply Chain Content","Get updates on DM Content","Lead Profile",City,"Asymmetrique Activity Index","Asymmetrique Profile Index","Asymmetrique Activity Score","Asymmetrique Profile Score","I agree to pay the amount through cheque","A free copy of Mastering The Interview","Last Notable Activity"}	9240	37	341880	41039	0.7058823529411765

The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd-period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).	kaggle	{education,"standardized testing"}	{CC0-1.0}	{school,sex,age,address,famsize,Pstatus,Medu,Fedu,Mjob,Fjob,reason,guardian,traveltime,studytime,failures,schoolsup,famsup,paid,activities,nursery,higher,internet,romantic,famrel,freetime,goout,Dalc,Walc,health,absences,G1,G2,G3}	649	33	21417	0	1

381	health	COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset	&gt; ### “Health requires healthy food."###\nRoger Williams (1603 – 1683)\n\n<br>\nIn the past couple months, we’ve witnessed doctors, nurses, paramedics and thousands of medical workers putting their lives on the frontline to save patients who are infected. And as the battle with COVID-19 continues, we should all ask ourselves – What should we do to help out? What can we do to protect our loved ones, those who sacrifice for us, and ourselves from this pandemic?<br>\nThese questions all relate back to the CORD-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge Task Question: [“What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?” ](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=587)\n<br>\nAnd my simple answer is : **We need to protect our families and our own healths by adapting to a healthy diet.**\n<br>\n\n### Inspiration and Research Objectives\n\nThe USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion recommends a very simple daily diet intake guideline: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruits, and 20% protein, but are we really eating in the healthy eating style recommended by these food divisions and balances?\n<br>\nIn this dataset, I have combined data of different types of food, world population obesity and undernourished rate, and global COVID-19 cases count from around the world in order to learn more about how a healthy eating style could help combat the Corona Virus. And from the dataset, we can gather information regarding diet patterns from countries with lower COVID infection rate, and adjust our own diet accordingly. \n<br>\nIn each of the 4 datasets below, I have calculated fat quantity, energy intake (kcal),  food supply quantity (kg), and protein for different categories of food (all calculated as percentage of total intake amount). I've also added on the obesity and undernourished rate (also in percentage) for comparison. The end of the datasets also included the most up to date confirmed/deaths/recovered/active cases (also in percentage of current population for each country). \n<br>\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n- Data for different food group supply quantities, nutrition values, obesity, and undernourished percentages are obtained from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO website ](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home) To see the specific types of food included in each category from the FAO data, take a look at the last dataset `Supply_Food_Data_Description.csv`.\n\n- Data for population count for each country comes from Population Reference Bureau [PRB website ](https://www.prb.org/)\n\n- Data for COVID-19 confirmed, deaths, recovered and active cases are obtained from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering [CSSE website ](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)\n\n- The USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion diet intake guideline information can be found in [ChooseMyPlate.gov](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/)\n\n*Note: I will update and push new versions of the datasets weekly.

383	health	Fetal Health Classification	# Abstract\n&gt; Classify fetal health in order to prevent child and maternal mortality.\n\n# About this dataset\n&gt; ## Context\nReduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress.\nThe UN expects that by 2030, countries end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.\n\n&gt; Parallel to notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality, which accounts for **295 000 deaths** during and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). The vast majority of these deaths **(94%)** occurred in low-resource settings, and most **could have been prevented**.\n\n&gt; In light of what was mentioned above, **Cardiotocograms (CTGs)** are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n\n&gt; ## Data\nThis dataset contains **2126** records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into **3 classes**:\n- Normal\n- Suspect\n- Pathological\n\n\n# How to use\n&gt; - Create a multiclass model to classify CTG features into the three fetal health states.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\nAyres de Campos et al.

The dataset contains information on patient age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure levels, diabetic status, number of children, smoking status and region. By analyzing these key factors across geographical areas and across different demographics such as age or gender we can gain a greater understanding of who is most likely to receive an insurance claim. This understanding gives us valuable insight that can be used to inform our decision making when considering potential customers for our services. On a broader scale it can inform public policy by allowing for more targeted support for those who are most in need and vulnerable. These kinds of insights are extremely valuable and this dataset provides us with the tools we need to uncover them!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides a comprehensive examination of demographic and health data from insurance claims, which can be used to make predictions about a wide variety of health-related outcomes. It is designed to give users powerful insights into the relationship between different demographic factors such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure etc., the presence of chronic diseases like diabetes, smoking status and region with insurance claim amounts. \n> \n> In order to make use of this dataset for research purposes or machine learning applications like predictive analytics, it is important to take various factors into consideration while using it. The following are some tips on how to use this dataset: \n> - Make sure that you analyze all variables in relation with one another instead of treating them separately; this will help you understand how they interact and affect one another before creating models or drawing conclusions from the data. \n> - Observe any relationships among three or more variables together - e.g., what’s the correlation between age & gender vs claim amount? This can be done using multidimensional analysis methods like factor analysis (FA) or cluster analysis (CA).  \n> - Take into account hidden patterns in your dataset by looking for outliers or exceptions that might not otherwise be visible/apparent at first glance - these could signal unexpected influences on your variables when modeling/predicting results!  \n> - When applying regression models on this dataset keep in mind that its properties may change over time due to external conditions such as policy changes by insurers or general trends in claims; retrain your models periodically if necessary accordingly!  \n> 5 Finally when interpreting results obtained from analyzingthis datasets focus not only on numeric values but also try capturing qualitative characteristics so that you can get a deeper understanding about each variable influencing your prediction results!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Identifying trends in insurance claims based on age, gender, BMI, and blood pressure. \n> - Developing targeted marketing campaigns for customers at high risk of making an insurance claim. \n> - Investigating correlations between health traits (such as BMI and blood pressure) with the likelihood of making a claim\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/sumitrock)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: insurance_data.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                                              |\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Diabetic**  | Whether the insured person is diabetic or not.

394	health	Mental Health and Suicide Rates	### Context\n\nClose to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide.\n\nSuicide is a complex issue and therefore suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defense, politics, and the media. These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated as no single approach alone can make an impact on an issue as complex as suicide.\n\n### Do leave an upvote if you found this dataset useful!	kaggle	{"mental health"}	{"Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO)"}	{Country,Sex,2016,2015,2010,2000," 80_above"," 70to79"," 60to69 "," 50to59 "," 40to49"," 30to39"," 20to29"," 10to19",Year,"Mental _hospitals",health_units,"outpatient _facilities","day _treatment",residential_facilities,Psychiatrists,Nurses,Social_workers,Psychologists}	1317	29	10210	253	1

396	health	Mental Health	Mental health is an essential part of people’s lives and society. Poor mental health affects our well-being, our ability to work, and our relationships with friends, family, and community.\n\nMental health conditions are not uncommon. Hundreds of millions suffer from them yearly, and many more do over their lifetimes. It’s estimated that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men will experience major depression in their lives. Other conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are less common but still have a large impact on people’s lives.\n\n**Mental health data based on surveys**\nAside from the formal diagnoses, mental illnesses can be measured using surveys and screening questionnaires.\nThese tend to ask people about symptoms similar to those in diagnostic manuals, but they can be used more easily and widely because the data does not need to be collected by a healthcare professional.\n\n**What are the strengths and limitations of survey data?**\nStrengths of survey data\nSurvey data on mental health has two major strengths.\nFirst, it involves structured interviews – people are asked a consistent set of questions regardless of their interviewer. This helps to ensure the data is more comparable between interviewers and across time.12\nSecond, surveys include a much wider range of people in the population, including those who would not seek treatment due to a lack of awareness, costs, or other concerns.\n\nLimitations of survey data\n\nThere are also several limitations of survey data to keep in mind.\nOne is that people may not share their symptoms in surveys, as they may not feel comfortable sharing them with researchers. Along with this, people’s comfort in sharing mental health symptoms may vary between countries and over time.16\nAnother limitation is that people may not remember their symptoms, especially when they are asked to recall symptoms in their lifetime so far. This can be challenging for older people whose symptoms may have occurred decades ago.\n\nBy Saloni Dattani	kaggle	{"mental health"}	{other}	{Entity,Code,Year,"Schizophrenia disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Depressive disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Anxiety disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Bipolar disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Eating disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Depressive disorders","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Schizophrenia","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Bipolar disorder","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Eating disorders","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Anxiety disorders","Major depression","Bipolar disorder","Eating disorders",Dysthymia,Schizophrenia,"Anxiety disorders","Potentially adequate treatment, conditional","Other treatments, conditional","Untreated, conditional","Nearly every day","More than half the days","Several days","Not at all","Number of countries with primary data on prevalence of mental disorders"}	13355	46	106652	1034	0.7058823529411765

426	energy	MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset	# MAGIC gamma telescope data 2004\n\n## Dataset Information.\n\n   The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy\n   gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the\n   imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays,\n   taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced\n   inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the\n   atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks\n   through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction\n   of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by\n   the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a\n   plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of\n   few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns\n   (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those\n   caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers\n   initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).\n\n   Typically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated\n   cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis\n   is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is\n   directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed\n   in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse.\n   If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be\n   an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse\n   (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be\n   used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric\n   along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination.\n   There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the\n   extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.\n\n   The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in \n      D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers,\n      Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).\n   The program was run with parameters allowing to observe events with energies down\n   to below 50 GeV.\n\n**Number of Instances:** 19020\n\n**Number of Attributes:** 11 (including the class)\n\n**Attribute information:**\n\n    1.  fLength:  continuous  -  major axis of ellipse [mm]\n    2.  fWidth:   continuous  - minor axis of ellipse [mm] \n    3.  fSize:    continuous  - 10-log of sum of content of all pixels [in #phot]\n    4.  fConc:    continuous  - ratio of sum of two highest pixels over fSize  [ratio]\n    5.  fConc1:   continuous  - ratio of highest pixel over fSize  [ratio]\n    6.  fAsym:    continuous  - distance from highest pixel to center, projected onto major axis [mm]\n    7.  fM3Long:  continuous  - 3rd root of third moment along major axis  [mm] \n    8.  fM3Trans: continuous  - 3rd root of third moment along minor axis  [mm]\n    9.  fAlpha:   continuous  - angle of major axis with vector to origin [deg]\n    10.  fDist:    continuous  - distance from origin to center of ellipse [mm]\n    11.  class:    g,h  - gamma (signal), hadron (background)\n\n**Missing Attribute Values: None**\n\n**Class Distribution:**\n\n      g = gamma (signal):     12332\n      h = hadron (background): 6688\n\n   For technical reasons, the number of h events is underestimated.\n   In the real data, the h class represents the majority of the events.\n\n   The simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, since\n   classifying a background event as signal is worse than classifying a signal\n   event as background. For comparison of different classifiers an ROC curve\n   has to be used. The relevant points on this curve are those, where the\n   probability of accepting a background event as signal is below one of the\n   following thresholds: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 depending on the required\n   quality of the sample of the accepted events for different experiments.\n\n\n## Sources:\n\n   (a) Original owner of the database:\n\n       R.

429	energy	Renewable Energy (1960-2023)	Renewable energy is defined as the contribution of renewables to total primary energy supply (TPES). Renewables include the primary energy equivalent of hydro (excluding pumped storage), geothermal, solar, wind, tide and wave sources. Energy derived from solid biofuels, biogasoline, biodiesels, other liquid biofuels, biogases and the renewable fraction of municipal waste are also included. Biofuels are defined as fuels derived directly or indirectly from biomass (material obtained from living or recently living organisms). This includes wood, vegetal waste (including wood waste and crops used for energy production), ethanol, animal materials/wastes and sulphite lyes. Municipal waste comprises wastes produced by the residential, commercial and public service sectors that are collected by local authorities for disposal in a central location for the production of heat and/or power. This indicator is measured in thousand toe (tonne of oil equivalent) as well as in percentage of total primary energy supply.	kaggle	{energy,"renewable energy"}	{other}	{"ï»¿\\"LOCATION\\"",INDICATOR,SUBJECT,MEASURE,FREQUENCY,TIME,Value,"Flag Codes"}	15904	8	127232	15904	1

Additionally, renewable energy\n\n- improves public health\n- creates jobs\n- ensures energy security through diversification\n- stabilises energy prices\n\nThe importance of moving away from fossil fuels and towards renewable sources cannot be understated. As such, this dataset tracks the growth of the UK's renewable sector from 1990 to 2020.\n\n#Content\n\nThis dataset details the consumption of energy from 17 different renewable and waste sources from 1990 to 2020. It contains the energy use from each source individually as well as the total consumption. It also contains the total energy consumption from primary fuels and therefore the very useful metric: % of consumption from renewables!\n\nUnits: The unit of energy used in this dataset is the [megatonne of oil equivalent (mtoe)](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Tonne_of_oil_equivalent#:~:text=on%20the%20toe-,Mtoe,a%20tremendous%20amount%20of%20energy.) . For context 1 mtoe = 42 petajoules (42 x 10^15 J)\n\n#Dataset Notes\n\n- Wind includes wave and tidal from 2000\n- Cross-boundary adjustment includes use by UK residents abroad and excludes by foreign residents in UK territory. It applies to bioethanol and biodiesel.\n- All figures are reported to 3 decimal places. Total figures are based on raw data and therefore may not sum due to rounding. \n\n#Acknowledgements\n\nThis data is from Ricardo Energy and Environment, [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) and was downloaded from [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsenergyconsumptionfromrenewableandwastesources) on 9 October 2022.\n\nThe dataset's release date was 9 June 2022.\n\nThe dataset is licensed under the [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) according to [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2001censusandearlier/dataandproducts/copyrightandlicensing/licenseinformation).\n	kaggle	{"renewable energy",tabular}	{other}	{ï»¿Year,"Energy from renewable & waste sources","Total energy consumption of primary fuels and equivalents","Fraction from renewable sources and waste","Hydroelectric power","Wind, wave, tidal","Solar photovoltaic","Geothermal aquifers","Landfill gas","Sewage gas","Biogas from autogen","Municipal solid waste (MSW)","Poultry litter",Straw,Wood,Charcoal,"Liquid bio-fuels",Bioethanol,Biodiesel,Biomass,"Cross-boundary Adjustment"}	31	21	651	0	1

The balance of a net exporter appears as a negative value (-). The balance of geographic and geopolitical zones is simply the sum of the trade balance of all countries.\n\n- CO2 emissions from fuel combustion: CO2 emissions cover only the emissions from fossil fuel combustion (coal, oil and gas). They are calculated according to the UNFCCC methodology. Here the reference approach is presented, ie the sum of CO2 emissions of each energy.\n\n- CO2 intensity: CO2 intensity is the ratio of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion over Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measured in constant US $ at purchasing power parities. It measures the CO2 emitted to generate one unit of GDP. GDP is expressed at constant exchange rate and purchasing power parity to remove the impact of inflation and reflect differences in general price levels and relate energy consumption to the real level of economic activity. Using purchasing power parity rates for GDP instead of exchange rates increases the value of GDP in regions with a low cost of living, and therefore decreases their energy intensities.\n\n- Crude oil: Crude oil includes all liquid hydrocarbons to be refined: crude oil, liquids from natural gas (NGL), and semi-refined products.\n\n- Crude oil, coal and lignite production : corresponds to gross production.\n\n- Electricity production: Electricity production corresponds to gross production. It includes public production (production of private and public electricity utilities) and industrial producers for their own uses, by any type of power plant (including cogeneration).\n\n- Energy intensity of GDP at constant purchasing power parities: The energy intensity is the ratio of primary energy consumption over Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measured in constant US $ at purchasing power parities. It measures the total amount of energy necessary to generate one unit of GDP. GDP is expressed at constant exchange rate and purchasing power parity to remove the impact of inflation and reflect differences in general price levels and relate energy consumption to the real level of economic activity. Using purchasing power parity rates for GDP instead of exchange rates increases the value of GDP in regions with a low cost of living, and therefore decreases their energy intensities.\n\n- Natural gas production: Natural gas production corresponds to the marketed production (i.e. excluding quantities flared or reinjected).\n\n- NGL : Natural Gas Liquids\n\n- Oil products: Oil products are all liquid hydrocarbons, obtained by the refining of crude oil and NGL and by treatment of natural gas, in particular, LPG production (Liquid Petroleum Gas) includes LPG from natural gas separation plants. Ethanol used as motor fuel in Brazil as well as fuels derived from coal in South Africa are not included in oil products.\n\n- Share of renewables in electricity production: Ratio between the electricity production from renewables (hydro, wind, geothermal and solar) and the total electricity production.\n\n- Share of wind and solar in electricity production: Electricity produced from wind and solar energy divided by the total electricity production.\n\n- Share of electricity in total final energy consumption: Final electricity demand divided by the total final energy consumption. \n\n- Total primary production: Primary production evaluates the quantity of natural energy resources ("primary energy sources") extracted or produced. For natural gas, the quantities flared or reinjected are excluded. Production of hydro, geothermal, nuclear and wind electricity is considered as primary production.\n\n- Total energy consumption: The total energy consumption is the balance of primary production, external trade, marine bunkers and stock changes. The total energy consumption includes biomass.For the world, marine bunkers are included. This induces a gap with the sum of regions.\n\n- Average CO2 emission factor: The average CO2 emission factor (carbon factor) is calculated doing the ratio between emissions over primary energy consumption.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n	kaggle	{energy}	{world-bank}	{ï»¿country,Year,Region,"CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (MtCO2)","Average CO2 emission factor (tCO2/toe)","CO2 intensity at constant purchasing power parities (kCO2/$15p)","Total energy production (Mtoe)","Total energy consumption (Mtoe)","Share of renewables in electricity production (%)","Share of electricity in total final energy consumption (%)","Oil products domestic consumption (Mt)","Refined oil products production (Mt)","Natural gas production (bcm)","Natural gas domestic consumption (bcm)","Energy intensity of GDP at constant purchasing power parities (koe/$15p)","Electricity production (TWh)","Electricity domestic consumption (TWh)","Coal and lignite domestic consumption (Mt)","Share of wind and solar in electricity production (%)","Crude oil production (Mt)","Coal and lignite production (Mt)"}	1364	21	28644	0	0.8235294117647058

We believe that the sales price of a car is not only based on the value of the product itself, but is also heavily influenced by things like market trends, current availability and politics.\nWith this challenge we hope to raise some interest in this exciting topic and also gain some insight in what the main factors are that drive the value of a used car.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data provided consists of almost 5000 real BMW cars that were sold via a b2b auction in 2018. The price shown in the table is the highest bid that was reached during the auction.\n\nWe have already done some data cleanup and filtered out cars with engine damage etc. However there may still be minor damages like scratches, but we do not have more information about that.\n\nWe have also extracted 8 criteria based on the equipment of car that we think might have a good impact on the value of a used car. These criteria have been labeled feature_1 to feature_8 and are shown in the data below.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWe would like to find a good statistical model to describe the value of a used car depending on the basic description and the 8 provided features. The following questions are of special interest to us:\n\n1. How much impact does each of features have on the estimate value of the car?\n\n2. How does the estimated value of a car change over time? Can you detect any patterns? (e.g. the price of a convertible should be higher in summer than in winter)\n\n3. How big is the influence of the factors not represented in the data on the price? Or, in other words, what is the estimated variance included in your statistical model?	kaggle	{"retail and shopping","ratings and reviews"}	{CC0-1.0}	{maker_key,model_key,mileage,engine_power,registration_date,fuel,paint_color,car_type,feature_1,feature_2,feature_3,feature_4,feature_5,feature_6,feature_7,feature_8,price,sold_at}	4843	18	87174	0	0.7647058823529411
437	politics	Dutch politics: the childcare benefits scandal	From Wikipedia:\n\nThe Dutch childcare benefits scandal (Dutch: kinderopvangtoeslagaffaire or toeslagenaffaire, lit. '[childcare] benefits affair') is a political scandal in the Netherlands concerning false allegations of fraud made by the Tax and Customs Administration while attempting to regulate the distribution of childcare benefits. Between 2013 and 2019, authorities wrongly accused an estimated 26,000 parents of making fraudulent benefit claims, requiring them to pay back the allowances they had received in their entirety. In many cases, this sum amounted to tens of thousands of euros, driving families into severe financial hardship.\n\nThe scandal was brought to public attention in September 2018. Investigators have subsequently described the working procedure of the Tax and Customs Administration as "discriminatory" and filled with "institutional bias". On 15 January 2021, two months before the 2021 general election, the third Rutte cabinet resigned over the scandal following a parliamentary inquiry into the matter, which concluded that "fundamental principles of the rule of law" had been violated.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal\n\n	kaggle	{politics}	{CC0-1.0}	{user_name,user_location,user_followers,user_friends,user_verified,date,text,hashtags,source,language,is_retweet}	8088	11	88968	5951	0.7647058823529411

[BuzzFeed News][1] analyzed over 1,000 stories from hyperpartisan political Facebook pages selected from the right, left, and mainstream media to determine the nature and popularity of false or misleading information they shared.\n \n### Content\n\nThis dataset supports the original story [“Hyperpartisan Facebook Pages Are Publishing False And Misleading Information At An Alarming Rate”][2] published October 20th, 2016. Here are more details on the methodology used for collecting and labeling the dataset (reproduced from the story):\n  \n**More on Our Methodology and Data Limitations**\n\n“Each of our raters was given a rotating selection of pages from each category on different days. In some cases, we found that pages would repost the same link or video within 24 hours, which caused Facebook to assign it the same URL. When this occurred, we did not log or rate the repeat post and instead kept the original date and rating. Each rater was given the same guide for how to review posts:\n \n* “*Mostly True*: The post and any related link or image are based on factual information and portray it accurately. This lets them interpret the event/info in their own way, so long as they do not misrepresent events, numbers, quotes, reactions, etc., or make information up. This rating does not allow for unsupported speculation or claims.\n \n* “*Mixture of True and False*: Some elements of the information are factually accurate, but some elements or claims are not. This rating should be used when speculation or unfounded claims are mixed with real events, numbers, quotes, etc., or when the headline of the link being shared makes a false claim but the text of the story is largely accurate. It should also only be used when the unsupported or false information is roughly equal to the accurate information in the post or link. Finally, use this rating for news articles that are based on unconfirmed information.    \n\n* “*Mostly False*: Most or all of the information in the post or in the link being shared is inaccurate. This should also be used when the central claim being made is false.    \n \n* “*No Factual Content*: This rating is used for posts that are pure opinion, comics, satire, or any other posts that do not make a factual claim. This is also the category to use for posts that are of the “Like this if you think...” variety.\n \n“In gathering the Facebook engagement data, the API did not return results for some posts. It did not return reaction count data for two posts, and two posts also did not return comment count data. There were 70 posts for which the API did not return share count data. We also used CrowdTangle's API to check that we had entered all posts from all nine pages on the assigned days. In some cases, the API returned URLs that were no longer active. We were unable to rate these posts and are unsure if they were subsequently removed by the pages or if the URLs were returned in error.”\n \n### Acknowledgements\n \nThis dataset was originally published on GitHub by BuzzFeed News here: https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-10-facebook-fact-check \n \n### Inspiration\n \nHere are some ideas for exploring the hyperpartisan echo chambers on Facebook:\n \n* How do left, mainstream, and right categories of Facebook pages differ in the stories they share?\n\n* Which types of stories receive the most engagement from their Facebook followers? Are videos or links more effective for engagement?\n\n* Can you replicate BuzzFeed’s findings that “the least accurate pages generated some of the highest numbers of shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook”?\n\n\n#[Start a new kernel][3]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/buzzfeed\n  [2]: https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis?utm_term=.kq9kqJDZ2#.ia1QB2KJl.\n  [3]: https://www.kaggle.com/buzzfeed/fact-checking-facebook-politics-pages/kernels?modal=true	kaggle	{politics,internet,"social networks"}	{unknown}	{account_id,post_id,Category,Page,"Post URL","Date Published","Post Type",Rating,Debate,share_count,reaction_count,comment_count}	2282	12	27384	2058	0.7352941176470589

444	politics	Ideology Scores of Supreme Court Justices	# Context \n\nMeasuring the relative location of U.S. Supreme Court justices on an ideological continuum allows us to better understand the politics of the high court. Such measures are an important building blocking of statistical models of the Supreme Court, the separation of powers system, and the judicial hierarchy.\n\n\n# Content\n\nThe "Martin-Quinn" judicial ideology scores are estimated for every justice serving from the October 1937 term to the present. The measures are estimated using a dynamic item response theory model, allowing judicial ideology to trend smoothly through time. Since the scores are estimated from a probability model, they can be used to form other quantities of interest, such as locating the pivotal "median" justice, as all well the location of each case in the policy space. \n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe Martin-Quinn scores were developed by Andrew D. Martin of the University of Michigan and Kevin M. Quinn of the UC Berkeley School of Law and supported by a National Science Foundation grant.

446	politics	Mental Health and Suicide Rates	### Context\n\nClose to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide.\n\nSuicide is a complex issue and therefore suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defense, politics, and the media. These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated as no single approach alone can make an impact on an issue as complex as suicide.\n\n### Do leave an upvote if you found this dataset useful!	kaggle	{"mental health"}	{"Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO)"}	{Country,Sex,2016,2015,2010,2000," 80_above"," 70to79"," 60to69 "," 50to59 "," 40to49"," 30to39"," 20to29"," 10to19",Year,"Mental _hospitals",health_units,"outpatient _facilities","day _treatment",residential_facilities,Psychiatrists,Nurses,Social_workers,Psychologists}	1317	29	10210	253	1

Trump was impeached in the House of Representatives. This marked another chapter in a long saga of public conversation surrounding actions of the executive. There are differing opinions on whether impeachment is warranted or not, but what is certain is that we have access to data that can help us uncover insights into this era of American politics. \n\nPolling data leading up to Trump's impeachment was gathered from a public master list on google sheets. Link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS15V8lYPUc_OH4OBss6d8NPGRnCH1lAlBBY4FYWcK6cm6iVM8dXE_4KMFOUybRe-cVvDg7ap46FPig/pubhtml?gid=39569490&single=true). It contains polling data from all major pollsters between January 23 2017 and January 8 2020.\n\nWhat new insights can be uncovered? Is there a larger story unfolding in American politics underneath partisan division in congress? Where do the American people stand in all of this? \n\nAcknowledgements to Aaron Bycoffe, Ella Koeze, and Nathaniel Rakich for their initial article and analysis of this data.

453	politics	2020 US General Election Turnout Rates	# Intro\nVoter turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot in an election. Eligibility varies by country, and the voting-eligible population should not be confused with the total adult population. Age and citizenship status are often among the criteria used to determine eligibility, but some countries further restrict eligibility based on sex, race, or religion.\n# Context\nThe historical trends in voter turnout in the United States presidential elections have been determined by the gradual expansion of voting rights from the initial restriction to white male property owners aged 21 or older in the early years of the country's independence, to all citizens aged 18 or older in the mid-20th century. Voter turnout in United States presidential elections has historically been higher than the turnout for midterm elections.\n![f](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/U.S._Vote_for_President_as_Population_Share.png)\n# Content\nTurnout rates by demographic breakdown from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, November Voting and Registration Supplement (or CPS for short).

471	agriculture	The National Summary of Meats	Beef. Lamb. Veal. We might not all eat them, but they are the meats whose grades the US Department of Agriculture has seen fit to publish. This dataset contains records on meat production and quality as far back as 1930. \n\nAfter meat and poultry are inspected for wholesomeness, producers and processors may request that they have products graded for quality by a licensed Federal grader. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (http://www.ams.usda.gov) is the agency responsible for grading meat and poultry. Those who request grading must pay for the service. Grading for quality means the evaluation of traits related to tenderness, juiciness, and flavor of meat; and, for poultry, a normal shape that is fully fleshed and meaty and free of defects.\n\nUSDA grades are based on nationally uniform Federal standards of quality. No matter where or when a consumer purchases graded meat or poultry, it must have met the same grade criteria. The grade is stamped on the carcass or side of beef and is usually not visible on retail cuts. However, retail packages of beef, as well as poultry, will show the U.S. grade mark if they have been officially graded.\n\nTo better understand the available fields:\n - All fields labeled 'pounds' are really in units of indicate millions\n   of pounds.\n - You can find a helpful explanation of what the different grades mean\n   [here][1].\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis data was kindly released by the US Department of Agriculture. You can find [their most recent meat updates here][2].\n\n### Inspiration\n\n - This is a good dataset for anyone looking to do basic data cleanup. I've converted it into a properly formed CSV, but there are still numerous missing values, footnoted fields, and exceptions.\n - This is a good candidate for regression analysis, especially in conjunction with other datasets.

464	agriculture	Environment Impact of Food Production	### Context\n\nAs the world’s population has expanded and gotten richer, the demand for food, energy and water has seen a rapid increase. Not only has demand for all three increased, but they are also strongly interlinked: food production requires water and energy; traditional energy production demands water resources; agriculture provides a potential energy source. This article focuses on the environmental impacts of food. Ensuring everyone in the world has access to a nutritious diet in a sustainable way is one of the greatest challenges we face.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains most 43 most common foods grown across the globe and 23 columns as their respective land, water usage and carbon footprints. \n\nColumns\n1. Land use change - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product \n2. Animal Feed - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n3. Farm   - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n4. Processing - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n5. Transport - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n6. Packaging - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n7. Retail - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n\nThese represent greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product) across different stages in the lifecycle of food production.\n\nEutrophication – the pollution of water bodies and ecosystems with excess nutrients – is a major environmental problem. The runoff of nitrogen and other nutrients from agricultural production systems is a leading contributor.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nhttps://ourworldindata.org\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\n1.

465	agriculture	European Agriculture Indicators	**### Context**\nThe dataset is used to explore and visualize the differences between the Agricultural Sectors across European countries. While the Common Agricultural Policy is using a set of priorities and financial mechanisms more or less standardized across EU member states, there are huge differences between the West and the East of Europe in terms of their agricultural sectors. Romania is a particular interesting case, having one of the most fragmented and least productive agricultural sector. \n\n**### Content**\nThe database contains a selection of Farm Structure Indicators for EU member states (28 countries, including UK). The selected indicators provide an overview of the European Agricultural sector (for a non-expert public) and allow for relevant comparisons between EU countries.\nData covers the year 2016, the most recent year for which Farm Structure data was provided by Eurostat. Since multiple countries conducted their Agricultural Census in the period 2020-2021, more recent data is expected to be published soon.\n\nThe indicators were selected and downloaded from the Eurostat database. The indicators come from 4 different Eurostat data tables: [ef_m_farmleg], [ef_lf_main], [ef_mp_training], [ef_m_farmang]. Given the different structure of the datasets provided by Eurostat, the indicators were merged into the final database using a series of VLOOKUP functions in Microsoft Excel.\n\n### Inspiration\nI will be using the data to produce a series of maps (in leaflet() or tmap() in R), exploring cross country differences and trying to answer questions about how "common" really is the European Agriculture.\n	kaggle	{europe,business,agriculture}	{"EU ODP Legal Notice"}	{Country,farms_number,used_agricultural_area_ha,standard_output_EUR,subsistence_semisubsistence_farms,total_labour_persons,total_labour_AWU,nonfamily_labour_persons,nonfamily_labour_AWU,managers_basic_training,managers_only_practical,managers_full_training,managers_training_NA,farms_SO_zero,farms_SO_less2000,farms_SO_2000-3999,farms_SO_4000-7999,farms_SO_8000-14999,farms_SO_15000-24999,farms_SO_25000-49999,farms_SO_50000-99999,farms_SO_100000-249999,farms_SO_250000-499999,farms_SO_500000_orover}	28	24	672	28	1

467	agriculture	Mental Health and Suicide Rates	### Context\n\nClose to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide.\n\nSuicide is a complex issue and therefore suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defense, politics, and the media. These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated as no single approach alone can make an impact on an issue as complex as suicide.\n\n### Do leave an upvote if you found this dataset useful!	kaggle	{"mental health"}	{"Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO)"}	{Country,Sex,2016,2015,2010,2000," 80_above"," 70to79"," 60to69 "," 50to59 "," 40to49"," 30to39"," 20to29"," 10to19",Year,"Mental _hospitals",health_units,"outpatient _facilities","day _treatment",residential_facilities,Psychiatrists,Nurses,Social_workers,Psychologists}	1317	29	10210	253	1

479	chemistry	Industrial data from the ladle-furnace unit	## General information\n\nLadle furnace unit (LFU) - metallurgical equipment for out-of-furnace steel processing in the converter shop. The LFU is a large metal ladle with a volume of about 100 tons and is lined from the inside with refractory bricks. Molten steel is poured into the LFU from a steel ladle and then heated by graphite electrodes inserted into the unit's lid.\n\nIn addition to electric heating, desulfurization (removal of sulfur from the melt), adjustment of the chemical composition, and sampling are carried out at the CPC. Alloying of metal is carried out both with lumpy ferroalloys through the system to supply **bulk** materials from bunkers and with **wire** materials through a tube apparatus. Averaging the chemical composition and temperature is carried out through the bottom purge device in the steel ladle.\n\nAfter completion of processing at the LFU, the melt is poured back into the steel ladle and either sent to other metal finishing units or to a continuous casting plant, where it solidifies in the form of metallurgical slabs.\n\n## Content\n\nEach time the melt enters the Ladle Furnace Unit, the initial temperature and chemical composition are measured. Then, if necessary, the melt is heated for several minutes, after which alloying materials are added, purged with a gas, stirring the melt, and measurements are again carried out following the approved Technological Instruction. This cycle is repeated several times until the target chemistry and melting temperature are reached. In this case, it is not necessary that the melt would be heated in each cycle.\n\nThe given datasets provide information on the main technological operations performed at the Ladle Furnace Unit (such as heating, ferroalloy output, chemistry measurement, etc.) with a time reference.\n\n## Files\n\n- `data_gas.csv` - the file with supplied gases for purging\n- `data_bulk.csv` - the file with the given bulk elements\n- `data_bulk_time.csv` - the file with the time of bulk delivery\n- `data_wire.csv` - the file with wire supply\n- `data_wire_time.csv` - the file with wire recoil time\n- `data_arc.csv` - the file with information on the supplied electricity\n- `data_temp.csv` - the file with temperature measurements\n\nThe latter file is missing part of the temperature measurements. \n\n- `data_temp_FULL_with_test.csv` with the test sample\n\n*There is no information about the decoding of the **wire** and **bulk** parameters.*\n\n##The main problem \nTemperature forecasting: it is required to build a model that will predict what temperature measurements were at these points in time.	kaggle	{"earth and nature",business,manufacturing,"time series analysis",tabular,regression}	{CC0-1.0}	{key,"Heating start","Heating end","Active power","Reactive power","Bulk 1","Bulk 2","Bulk 3","Bulk 4","Bulk 5","Bulk 6","Bulk 7","Bulk 8","Bulk 9","Bulk 10","Bulk 11","Bulk 12","Bulk 13","Bulk 14","Bulk 15","Gas 1",time,Temperature,"Wire 1","Wire 2","Wire 3","Wire 4","Wire 5","Wire 6","Wire 7","Wire 8","Wire 9"}	62349	65	338048	121223	1

Osmolarity is proportional to the concentration of\nmolecules in solution; (4) conductivity (mMho milliMho). One Mho is one\nreciprocal Ohm. Conductivity is proportional to the concentration of charged\nions in solution; (5) urea concentration in millimoles per litre; and (6) calcium\nconcentration (CALC) in millimolesllitre.\n\nThe data is obtained from 'Physical Characteristics of Urines With and Without Crystals',a chapter from Springer Series in Statistics.\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-5098-2_45	kaggle	{health}	{unknown}	{gravity,ph,osmo,cond,urea,calc,target}	79	7	553	0	0.8823529411764706
481	chemistry	Mice Protein Expression	### Context\n\nExpression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear conditioning, a task used to assess associative learning.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of cortex. There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for a total of 72 mice. In the experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse. Therefore, for control mice, there are 38x15, or 570 measurements, and for trisomic mice, there are 34x15, or 510 measurements. The dataset contains a total of 1080 measurements per protein. Each measurement can be considered as an independent sample/mouse. \n\nThe eight classes of mice are described based on features such as genotype, behavior and treatment. According to genotype, mice can be control or trisomic. According to behavior, some mice have been stimulated to learn (context-shock) and others have not (shock-context) and in order to assess the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice, some mice have been injected with the drug and others have not. \n\nClasses: \n\n1. **c-CS-s**: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) \n\n2. **c-CS-m**: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) \n\n3. **c-SC-s**: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) \n\n4. **c-SC-m**: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) \n\n5. **t-CS-s**: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (7 mice) \n\n6. **t-CS-m**: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice) \n\n7. **t-SC-s**: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) \n\n8. **t-SC-m**: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice)\n\n### Attribute Information\n\n[1] **Mouse ID** \n\n[2:78] **Values of expression levels of 77 proteins**; the names of proteins are followed by N indicating that they were measured in the nuclear fraction. *For example: DYRK1A_n*\n\n[79] **Genotype**: control (c) or trisomy (t) \n\n[80] **Treatment type**: memantine (m) or saline (s) \n\n[81] **Behavior**: context-shock (CS) or shock-context (SC) \n\n[82] **Class**: c-CS-s, c-CS-m, c-SC-s, c-SC-m, t-CS-s, t-CS-m, t-SC-s, t-SC-m\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nClara Higuera Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Informatics and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Chemistry, University Complutense, Madrid, Spain. \nEmail: clarahiguera at ucm.es \n\nKatheleen J.

483	chemistry	Nobel prize from 1901 till 2020	### Context\n\nThe Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances. The will of the Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist Alfred Nobel established the five Nobel prizes in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901. The prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards available in their respective fields.\n\nBetween 1901 and 2020, the Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded to 949 people . The Nobel Prize is an international award administered by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden, and based on the fortune of Alfred Nobel, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. Each Prize consists of a medal, a personal diploma, and a cash award.\n\nA person or organization awarded the Nobel Prize is called Nobel Laureate. The word "laureate" refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honor.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset includes a record for every individual that was awarded the Nobel Prize since 1901.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is available on [Nobel prize api](https://nobelprize.readme.io/docs).\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWhich country has won the most prizes in each category? 	kaggle	{history,"computer science","data visualization"}	{ODbL-1.0}	{firstname,surname,born_country_code,died_country_code,gender,year,category,share,name_of_university,city_of_university,country_of_university,born_month,age,age_get_prize}	923	14	12922	995	1

485	chemistry	Periodic Table of the Elements	# Context \n\nObservations of particles much smaller than us, and various understandings of those particles, have propelled mankind forward in ways once impossible to imagine. "The elements" are what we call the sequential patterns in which some of these particles manifest themselves.\n\nAs a chemistry student and a coder, I wanted to do what came naturally to me and make my class a bit easier by coding/automating my way around some of the tedious work involved with calculations. Unfortunately, it seems that chemical-related datasets are not yet a thing which have been conveniently formatted into downloadable databases (as far as my research went). I decided that the elements would be a good place to start data collection, so I did that, and I'd like to see if this is useful to others as well.\n\nOther related data sets I'd like to coalesce are some large amount of standard entropies and enthalpies of various compounds, and many of the data sets from the *CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics*. I also think as many diagrams as possible should be documented in a way that can be manipulated and read via code.\n\n# Content\n\nIncluded here are three data sets. Each data set I have included is in three different formats (CSV, JSON, Excel), for a total of nine files.\n\nTable of the Elements:\n\n - This is the primary data set.\n - 118 elements in sequential order\n - 72 features\n\nReactivity Series:\n\n - 33 rows (in order of reactivity - most reactive at the top)\n - 3 features (symbol, name, ion)\n\nElectromotive Potentials:\n\n - 284 rows (in order from most negative potential to most positive)\n - 3 features (oxidant, reductant, potential)\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nAll of the data was scraped from 120 pages on Wikipedia using scripts. The links to those scripts are available in the dataset descriptions.\n\n\n# Extra\n\nIf you are interested in trying the chemistry calculations code I made for completing some of my repetitive class work, it's publicly available on [my GitHub][1].

In the table, the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number of one, hydrogen. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in that particular nucleus of an atom. In the periodic table the elements are arranged into periods and groups. A row of elements across the table is called a period. Each period has a number; from 1 to 8. Period 1 has only 2 elements in it: hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements. Other periods are longer. Elements in a period have consecutive atomic numbers.	kaggle	{chemistry}	{CC0-1.0}	{AtomicNumber,Element,Symbol,AtomicMass,NumberofNeutrons,NumberofProtons,NumberofElectrons,Period,Group,Phase,Radioactive,Natural,Metal,Nonmetal,Metalloid,Type,AtomicRadius,Electronegativity,FirstIonization,Density,MeltingPoint,BoilingPoint,NumberOfIsotopes,Discoverer,Year,SpecificHeat,NumberofShells,NumberofValence}	118	28	3304	636	1

488	chemistry	Secchi Depth	A Secchi disk is a circular disk with alternating black and white quadrants that is used to measure the clarity or transparency of water. It is typically lowered into the water using a line, and the depth at which it disappears from view is measured. The depth at which the disk disappears is called the "Secchi depth" and it provides an indication of the water clarity.\n\nMeasuring water transparency is important for a few reasons. First, it can indicate the health of aquatic ecosystems. Clear water allows sunlight to penetrate deeper, which is important for photosynthesis by aquatic plants and algae. If the water becomes cloudy or turbid, it can indicate that there is too much sediment or other particles in the water, which can have negative impacts on the ecosystem.\n\nSecond, water transparency can also impact water quality for human use. For example, if the water is too turbid, it can make it difficult to treat for drinking water or for use in industrial processes. Additionally, if the water is too cloudy or turbid, it can impact recreational uses such as swimming or fishing.\n\nOverall, measuring water transparency using a Secchi disk can provide important information about the health and quality of aquatic ecosystems, as well as the suitability of water for human use.\n\nThis dataset is sampled from 135 locations along the eastern coast of Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada from 2003-2005. It provides data on the Secchi depth alongside the characteristics of the water.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F6247135%2F33db54e2761af367ead97b0aa070190f%2Fsecchi_demonstration.jpeg?generation=1679696033632439&alt=media)	kaggle	{"water bodies","earth and nature",environment,tabular,canada}	{CC0-1.0}	{ï»¿secchi,date,depth,alkalinity,calcium,chlorophyll_a_corrected,chlorophyll_a_total,chlorophyll_b_total,chloride,color,conductivity_25,conductivity_estimate,carbon_inorganic,carbon_organic,hardness,potassium,magnesium,sodium,ammonium,nitrite,nitrates_total,nitrogen,ph,phosphate,phosphorus_unfiltered,phosphorus_total,residue,silicates,sulphate,turbidity}	404	30	12120	96	1

493	entertainment	Disney+ Hotstar Tv and Movie Catalog	Disney+ Hotstar (also known as Hotstar) is an Indian brand of subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned by Novi Digital Entertainment of Disney Star and operated by Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, both divisions of The Walt Disney Company.\n\nThe brand was first introduced as Hotstar for a streaming service carrying content from Disney Star's local networks, including films, television series, live sports, and original programming, as well as featuring content licensed from third-parties such as HBO and Showtime among others. Amid the significant growth of mobile broadband in India, Hotstar quickly became the dominant streaming service in the country.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Star India's parent company 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019, Hotstar was integrated with the company's new global streaming brand Disney+ as 'Disney+ Hotstar' in April 2020. The co-branded service added Disney+ original programming, and films and television series from its main content brands of Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and National Geographic alongside the domestic and third-party content already carried on the platform.\n\nOutside of India, the Disney+ Hotstar service also operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, which similarly combines entertainment content licensed from local, third-party studios, with the larger Disney+ library. Disney+ Hotstar is also expected to launch in the Philippines and Vietnam in the end of 2022. In Singapore, Canada, and the United Kingdom, Hotstar operates as a streaming service targeting overseas Indians, focusing on Disney Star's domestic entertainment and sports content; Disney+ operates as a standalone service in these markets. In 2021, Disney announced that it would discontinue the U.S. version of Hotstar in November 2021, in favor of adding its content to the domestic Hulu and ESPN+ services instead.	kaggle	{"arts and entertainment","movies and tv shows",nlp,"recommender systems",tabular}	{CC-BY-SA-3.0}	{hotstar_id,title,description,genre,year,age_rating,running_time,seasons,episodes,type}	6874	10	68740	11442	1
494	entertainment	Entertainment in Saudi Arabia	The Entertainment_KSA.csv dataset contains data on various entertainment spots in Saudi Arabia. With over 500 rows of data, this dataset provides information on the name, rating, review count, genre, location, and best comment for each entertainment spot. This dataset can be used to analyze the entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia and understand the types of entertainment spots available in the country.\n\nThe way of creating datasets like Entertainment_KSA.csv is by web scraping information from public sources such as Google Maps or Yelp. Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using software tools. In this case, a web scraper would be programmed to visit the relevant pages on Google Maps or Yelp and extract information on entertainment spots such as name, rating, review count, genre, location, and best comment.\n\nThe scraped data can then be saved in a CSV file, like the Entertainment_KSA.csv dataset. Once the data is collected, it can be cleaned and processed to remove any errors or duplicates and then analyzed to gain insights into the entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs for inspiration, datasets like Entertainment_KSA.csv can be used for a variety of purposes, including market research, trend analysis, and predictive modeling. Researchers and data analysts can use this dataset to explore the types of entertainment spots available in Saudi Arabia, identify popular spots, and understand the factors that influence customer reviews and ratings.\n\nFor example, this dataset could be used to predict which new entertainment spots are likely to be successful based on their genre, location, and other factors. It could also be used to identify trends in the entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia, such as the increasing popularity of certain genres or the growth of entertainment spots in specific regions.	kaggle	{"arts and entertainment",celebrities,dance,games,travel,arabic}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Unnamed: 0",name,rating,review_count,genre,location,best_comment}	564	7	3948	277	1
