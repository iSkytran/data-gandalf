However, it contains a lot of additional relevant data: \n- Monthly average house prices\n- Yearly number of houses\n- Yearly number of houses sold\n- Yearly percentage of households that recycle\n- Yearly life satisfaction\n- Yearly median salary of the residents of the area \n- Yearly mean salary of the residents of the area \n- Monthly number of crimes committed \n- Yearly number of jobs\n- Yearly number of people living in the area\n- Area size in hectares \n\nThe data is split by areas of London called boroughs (a flag exists to identify these), but some of the variables have other geographical UK regions for reference (like England, North East, etc.).
