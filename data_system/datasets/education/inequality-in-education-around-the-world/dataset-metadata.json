  "descriptionNullable": "### Context\n\nIn today's interconnected world, the issue of inequality in education stands as a stark reminder of the disparities that persist across countries and communities. While strides have been made to improve access to education, a significant proportion of children still lack the opportunity to learn, particularly in low-income and conflict-affected regions. Quality of education also diverges, with well-equipped schools in affluent areas contrasting with under-resourced institutions in marginalized settings. Gender inequality further compounds the problem, as cultural norms and economic factors often impede girls' education in certain societies. Tackling inequality in education isn't just a matter of fairness; it's a critical step towards building equitable societies and empowering individuals to contribute meaningfully to their own development and that of their nations.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains historical data covering a range of indicators pertaining to educational inequality on a global scale.
