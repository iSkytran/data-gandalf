Here you'll find up-to-date information on institutes of higher learning from Princeton University at the top spot in Best National Universities to Williams College at No. 1 on the Best National Liberal Arts Colleges list.  \n&gt; \n&gt; This collection of data is all that's needed for potential students - parents, counselors and more - to evaluate their choices in selecting a college or university that perfectly meets their needs. For instance: what is the total tuition & fees cost? What are student enrollment numbers? How have students rated this school? Which universities have been recognized as top institutions in academics by U.S. News & World Report? What admissions criteria do these schools evaluate when considering an applicant's profile? The answers lie within this dataset! \n&gt; \n&gt; Explore each category separately as well as with other considerations through visuals like our scatter plot to get an inside look into collegiate education from enrollment patterns charted against yearly expenses including room & board charges without forgetting several crucial factors such as six-year graduation rates and freshman retention rates measured among nations' universities included here -allowing for comparison and assessment beforehand for a well-rounded experience such that you can find your own path ahead!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - \ud83d\udea8 **Your notebook can be here!** \ud83d\udea8! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset contains information on the quality, tuition, and enrollment data of 1,800 U.S.-based universities ranked by U.S. News & World Report from 2017. It includes rankings from the National University and Liberal Arts College lists in addition to relevant data points like tuition fees and undergraduate enrollments for each school. \n&gt; \n&gt; Users can take advantage of this dataset to build models that predict ranking or predicting cost-benefit results for students by using cost-related (tuition) metrics along with quality metrics (rankings). Alternatively users can use it to analyze trends between investments in higher education versus outcomes (ranking), or explore the relationship between enrollments for schools of varying rank tiers, etc... \n&gt; \n&gt; For more information on how rankings are calculated please refer to [this](http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings Title) methodology explainer on U.S news website\n&gt; \n&gt;  Here is an overview of all columns included in this dataset: \n&gt; \n&gt;  Columns:Name - institution name,Location - City and state where located,Rank - Ranking according to U.S News & World Report ,Description - Snippet of text overview from U.S News ,Tuition and fees \u2013 Combined tuition and fees for out\u2013of\u2013state students ,In\u2013state \u2013 Tuition and fees for in\u2013state students ,Undergraduate Enrollment \u2013 Number of enrolled undergraduate students . \n&gt; \n&gt; Using this column detail as a guide we can answer questions like \u2018which colleges give highest ROI ?\u2019 or \u2018Which college has highest number undergraduates?\u2019 .
