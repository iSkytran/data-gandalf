Osmolarity is proportional to the concentration of\nmolecules in solution; (4) conductivity (mMho milliMho). One Mho is one\nreciprocal Ohm. Conductivity is proportional to the concentration of charged\nions in solution; (5) urea concentration in millimoles per litre; and (6) calcium\nconcentration (CALC) in millimolesllitre.\n\nThe data is obtained from 'Physical Characteristics of Urines With and Without Crystals',a chapter from Springer Series in Statistics.\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-5098-2_45",
