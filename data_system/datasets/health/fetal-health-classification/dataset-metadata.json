The vast majority of these deaths **(94%)** occurred in low-resource settings, and most **could have been prevented**.\n\n&gt; In light of what was mentioned above, **Cardiotocograms (CTGs)** are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n\n&gt; ## Data\nThis dataset contains **2126** records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into **3 classes**:\n- Normal\n- Suspect\n- Pathological\n\n\n# How to use\n&gt; - Create a multiclass model to classify CTG features into the three fetal health states.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\nAyres de Campos et al.
