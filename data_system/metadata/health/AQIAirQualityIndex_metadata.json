It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air.\n\n[![air-quality-index-numerical-scale-vector-24061819.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/kgRWWChK/air-quality-index-numerical-scale-vector-24061819.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/tsy1HKb4)\n\n# Content\n- **data_date.csv** - date wise organised\n\n# Related Notebooks\n- [**AQI- Air Quality Index : EDA, Forecast [Scheduled]**](https://www.kaggle.com/azminetoushikwasi/aqi-air-quality-index-eda-forecast-scheduled/)\n\n\n# Download\n- kaggle API Command\n`!kaggle datasets download -d azminetoushikwasi/aqi-air-quality-index-scheduled-daily-update`\n\n## Disclaimer\n- The data collected are all publicly available and it's intended for educational purposes only.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n- Cover image taken from internet.\n\n## Appreciate, Support, Share",
