    "description": "### Context\n\nThis dataset makes the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) data (that is compiled by **Transparency International**) available to everyone for data analysis and/or data science.\nI'll update this dataset every year assuming Transparency International releases a new dataset every year.\n\n**From Transparency International** : The CPI scores and ranks countries/territories based on how corrupt a country\u2019s public sector is perceived to be. It is a composite index, a combination of surveys and assessments of corruption, collected by a variety of reputable institutions. The CPI is the most widely used indicator of corruption worldwide.\n\n### Content\n\nThis CPI dataset is for 10 years from 2010 to 2019; it contains data about 180 countries in the world, so it's a global dataset.\nIt was generated by the following steps :\n\n1. Download the datasets from each of the CPI reports for 10 years from [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/)\n1. Process the datasets (mainly converting from Excel to csv file format) using [this](https://github.com/jeegarmaru/CPIDataSet) code\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/) for making the dataset available on their website without which this, ofcourse, wouldn't be possible. I couldn't find any Licensing requirements for this dataset on their website, but if I missed something or if Transparency International wants to add that post-fact, please let me know so I can add it here.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nPlease feel free to ask your own questions with the data in this dataset & run your own data analysis or data science projects with it. Some of the questions that this might help us answer :\n\n1. Which countries/continents are moving in the right direction in terms of corruption over the last decade? (So, we can help them get there & shine them as an example). Which countries/continents are not?\n1. Can we predict the CPI score for any country, region or continent over the next few years? (If so, it can be used for many things like helping migrants, increasing/decreasing investments, etc.)",
