    "description": "### Context\n\nJoseph R. Biden Jr. accepted the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday night, beginning a general-election challenge to President Trump that Democrats cast this week as a rescue mission for a country equally besieged by a crippling pandemic and a White House defined by incompetence, racism and abuse of power. Speaking before a row of flags in his home state of Delaware, Mr. Biden urged Americans to have faith that they could \u201covercome this season of darkness,\u201d and pledged that he would seek to bridge the country\u2019s political divisions in ways Mr. Trump had not.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data contains the full speech that Joe Biden gave. It would be interesting to find words and phrases that Joe Biden put emphasis on and maybe get an idea of what kind of election we're heading towards. Will he seek the support from the left-wing or try to win over voters that have left the Democratic party for Trump?\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to rev.com for the transcript.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nLook for text patterns, words that he repeat and whether his speech is positive or negative.",
