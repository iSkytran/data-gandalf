    "description": "### Context\n\nBrexit was a big moment for UK politics and the impact of it is just beginning to be felt. At lot was said about why people voted the way they did. What I wanted to do here was look at the constituencies where people vot and break them down into groups. After looking at the data available this became: Degree, non born in the UK, %white population, and salary. When is came to ethnicity I was thinking mainly about rather then the individual voting, did the environment matter more. ie if you cam from a more multi cultural area, where you more likely to vote in a certain way...\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe vote was broken down into region in the UK rather than the usual constituencies like it is done for general elections. However the team at the BBC used the data provided by the electoral commission to work out how the constituencies would have voted. This is on Wikipedia\n\nThe other data gives a the make up of the constituencies in terms of UK born, salary, ethnicity and education level \n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nBBC, .gov.uk, Office of National Statistics\n\nJosh Starmar Videos on Decision trees - look up stat quest on you tube\n\n### Inspiration\n\nCan you get any useful correlations from this?",
