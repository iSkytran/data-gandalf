    "description": "### Context\n\nThe project was started as a web-scraping exercise to get more experience particularly with the scrapy framework. Since I daily check news from several sources I decided to get a webscraper do the work for me and look for the interesting headlines from politics and economics.\nThe news sources have been anonymised and the licence limited to non-commercial use since this is the prerequisite to scrape the data from those homepages.\n\n\n### Content\n\nIn the csv file you find around 8400 records of news headlines from 7 different sources. For each record a teaser (or sub-headline) and a headline is provided.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMy thanks go to Upendra who has a great Youtube channel on webscraping (https://www.youtube.com/user/eupendras).\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nAll data enthusiasts are highly welcome to use the data and make something out of it. I will try and practise topic modelling as well as translation tasks with transformer models. Any inspiration for this or comments on my notebooks (which I will publish shortly) are highly appreciated!",
