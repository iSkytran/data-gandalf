    "description": "In 2015, The Post began tracking details about each police-involved killing in the United States \u2014 the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the person was experiencing a mental-health crisis \u2014 by manually culling local news reports, collecting information from law enforcement websites and social media, and monitoring independent databases such as [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/) and the now-defunct Killed by Police project. In many cases, The Post conducts additional reporting.\n\nIn 2022, The Post updated its database to standardize and publish the names of the police agencies involved in each shooting to better measure accountability at the department level.\n\nThe 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. began a protest movement culminating in the Black Lives Matter movement and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. In this data set, The Post tracks only shootings with circumstances closely paralleling those like the killing of Brown \u2014 incidents in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths in this data set.\n\nThe FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. Since 2015, The Post has documented more than twice as many fatal shootings by police as recorded by federal officials on average annually. That gap has widened in recent years, as the FBI in 2021 tracked only a third of departments\u2019 fatal shootings.\n\nThe Post seeks to make records as comprehensive as possible; the database is updated regularly as fatal shootings are reported and as facts emerge about individual cases. At times, there may be a lag between the date of the shooting and its inclusion in the database because of delays in reporting and data verification.\n\nTo provide information about fatal police shootings since Jan. 1, 2015, send us an email at policeshootingsfeedback@washpost.com.",
