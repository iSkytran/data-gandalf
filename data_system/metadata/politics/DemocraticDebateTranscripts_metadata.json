    "description": "### Context\n\nThe Primary Season is in Full Swing! This is a collection of all Democratic Primary Debate Transcripts up until this point!\n\n### Content\n\nThis data comprises of data scraped from [rev.com](https://www.rev.com/) All data is taken as is, and some transformations are made in order to add additional columns for `speaker` and `speaking_time_seconds`. These are outlined in my kernel titled **Data Collection / Scraping (For Transparency)**. Check it out if you're curious!\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis would not be possible without the diligent transcription from *Rev*. I am not affiliated, but thanks to them for maintaining and making this public information!\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nA question I would love to answer is how do speech patterns change over time by candidate? Which candidates are consistent and which are more so \"people pleasers\"? Who's answers are most likely to actually be related to the question asked?",
