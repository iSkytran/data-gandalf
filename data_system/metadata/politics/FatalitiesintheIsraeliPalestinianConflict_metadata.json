Determine if there are any notable patterns or disparities in the data.\n3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilize the event location, district, and region information to perform geospatial analysis. Visualize the distribution of fatalities on a map and identify areas that have experienced higher levels of violence.\n4. **Hostilities Participation Analysis**: Investigate the extent of individuals' participation in hostilities before their deaths. Analyze the relationship between participation and the circumstances surrounding each fatality.\n5. **Injury Analysis**: Examine the types of injuries inflicted on individuals. Identify the most common types of injuries and assess their severity.\n6. **Weapons Used**: Analyze the ammunition and means by which the individuals were killed. Determine the most frequently used weapons or methods and evaluate their impact.\n7. **Victim Profiles**: Create profiles of the victims based on the available data such as age, gender, citizenship, and place of residence.
