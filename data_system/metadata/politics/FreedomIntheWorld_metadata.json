After spending 27 years behind bars, the South African icon had hoped to see his country become a model for Africa. Instead, xenophobia has marred that dream. \"\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/nelson-mandela-a-legacy-of-freedom/g-52327905\n\n\"For Gandhi, Freedom of the Individual Was the First and Last Goal. Gandhi believed that real swaraj would come \u201cnot by the acquisition of authority by a few, but by the acquisition of the capacity by all to resist authority when abused\"\nhttps://thewire.in/books/reading-gandhi-excerpt#:~:text=books-,For%20Gandhi%2C%20Freedom%20of%20the%20Individual%20Was%20the%20First%20and,to%20resist%20authority%20when%20abused%E2%80%9D.\n\nDalai Lama : \"Let us widen our perspective to include the well being of the whole world and its future generations in our vision of prosperity and freedom.\"\nhttps://www.dalailama.com/messages/world-peace/human-rights-democracy-and-freedom",
