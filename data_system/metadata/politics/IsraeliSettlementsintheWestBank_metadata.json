Each row includes the settlement name in English and Hebrew, year established, regional council, location in latitude/longitude coordinates and relative to the West Bank Barrier, and population estimates for the past fifteen years.\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe settlement population statistics were collected by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics.",
