I decided to create this dataset to explore how American views on abortion have evolved in the decades preceding the Dobbs V. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. In that particular court case, the Supreme Court also overturned the **1973 Roe V. Wade decision**, ending the *long-standing constitutional right to abortion* in the United States. Abortion has become a fixture of American politics in recent years, but few are able to take a bipartisan stance on the issue. I hope that the **objectiveness of the quantitative data** in this dataset can allow for a **more rational understanding** of the issue.\n\n\n# Data Sources\n##### The primary data source used was Gallup, an analytics company renowned for its expansive public opinion polls. With decades worth of data on the sentiments of Americans, Gallup is an organization uniquely equipped to illustrate the shifting attitudes on abortion. \n\n1. [Gallup's Historical Trends On Abortion](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx) - Gallup publicly released not only their opinion data about abortion, but also attached corresponding visualizations that conveyed to me the analytical potential of a compiled dataset.\n2. [Gallup's \"Where Do Americans Stand On Abortion?\"](https://news.gallup.com/poll/321143/americans-stand-abortion.aspx) - While searching for quality data sources regarding abortion (ex. MMWR, CDC, PMSS), I found this Gallup article, which piqued my interest and led me to their \"Historical Trends\" page.\n\n# Reponses Being Tracked\n- Q1\ua789 Should Abortions Be Legal?\n- Q2\ua789 Are You Pro-Choice Or Pro-Life (AFTER)?\n- Q2\ua789 Are You Pro-Choice Or Pro-Life (NOT AFTER)?\n- Q3\ua789 Should Roe V. Wade Be Overturned Or Not?\n- Q4\ua789 Which Stage of Pregnancy Should Abortion Be Legal Or Illegal?\n- Q5\ua789 How Does A Political Candidate\u02bcs Position On Abortion Affect Your Vote?\n- Q6\ua789 Is Abortion Morally Acceptable Or Wrong?\n- Q7\ua789 Are You Satisfied Or Dissatisfied With Nation\u02bcs Policies On Abortion?\n\n# Dataset History\n2023-02-04 - Dataset is created (17,474 days after the coverage start date).\n\n[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/justin-2028/US-Perspectives-on-Abortion-1975-2022) - The same data but on GitHub.\n\n# Code Starter\n[Link to Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/justin2028/us-perspectives-on-abortion-code-starter)\n\n# Acknowledgements\nThe idea for this dataset came from Ms. Katlen, my English teacher. A big thank you to her for the suggestion to explore how perspectives have changed about a woman's right to choose :)",
