Also, it does not contain all the tweets (5.3k from 5.9k), but I'll work to make all of them available in the next versions. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe tweets were extracted from [Aos Fatos](https://aosfatos.org/tweets-de-bolso/arquivo.html) archive. I preferred to use it as a source so the dataset could contain deleted tweets. \n\n\n### Contribute\n\nPlease point everything that is strange or you'd like to see on this dataset. This is an on going ",
