    "description": "Presidential elections occur quadrennially in years evenly divisible by 4, on the first Tuesday after November 1. Presidential candidates from the major political parties usually declare their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year before the election. The two major parties each nominate one candidate through a process of primary elections and nominating conventions during the election year.\n(source: Wikipedia)\n\n20 candidates are considered as nominees as of July 2023, mostly Republican. Only two Democrats are currently challenging the incumbent president. Republican and Democrat party candidates must meet [FiveThirtyEight's criteria for being a major candidate](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whos-a-serious-candidate-for-the-republican-nomination-and-whos-just-dreaming).\n\n<img alt=\"debate\" src=\"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/29/529c395e-9edb-4eb3-9c81-a97efddb2e8c/thumbnail/620x392/d013f9dd87015c08c9c16c4a3aab6476/2015-10-29t004638z2105922514tb3ebat025gavrtrmadp3usa-election-republicans.jpg\">\n\nThis dataset contains data on candidates and polling results.
