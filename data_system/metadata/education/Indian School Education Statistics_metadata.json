    "description": "# Context\n\nThis dataset contains information about Indian School Education Statistics of the year 2013-2014 to 2015-2016. Many public datasets from Indian Government are scattered and the goal here is to have all those datasets under one umbrella so that it is easy for beginners to find important datasets like this to start their Data Science journey.\n\n\n# Content\n\nI acquired this dataset from [here](https://data.gov.in/catalog/school-education-statistics?filters%5Bfield_catalog_reference%5D=4241621&format=json&offset=0&limit=6&sort%5Bcreated%5D=desc). Have a look at the website. \n\nThis dataset contains 7 files in .csv format. You can find a description for each column. Let me summarize it here too.\n1. Percentage of Schools with Drinking Water Facility from 2013-14 to 2015-16\n2. Gross Enrolment Ratio from 2013-14 to 2015-16\n3. Drop-out rate from 2012-13 to 2014-15\n4. Percentage of Schools with Computers from 2013-14 to 2015-16\n5. Percentage of Schools with Electricity from 2013-14 to 2015-16\n6. Schools with Boys Toilet from 2013-14 to 2015-16\n7. Schools with Girls Toilet from 2013-14 to 2015-16\n\n# Inspiration\n\nThis dataset is especially useful for starters in their Data Science journey, also whoever is interested in knowing how the education in India is progressing over the years. You can start your exploration by answering the below questions:\n\n- Which states have the highest Dropout Ratio?\n- Do boys and girls have enough water and toilet facilities available?\n- How is the Gross Enrollment ration for boys and girls in various levels of schooling life?\n- Which level of school life is there less number of enrollment? Is it dropping or increasing?\n- Any other ideas.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI thank the Indian Government for making it public under their [Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India](www.data.gov.in).",
