    "description": "I wanted to look at the relationship between US college tuition and the quality of schools in 2022.  While quality is very subjective, and the U.S. News & World Report rankings have received a lot of criticism of late for its methodology, it's still the most common means of evaluation. It is my hope that this dataset can be used to better evaluate the relationship between tuition and school rankings. ",
