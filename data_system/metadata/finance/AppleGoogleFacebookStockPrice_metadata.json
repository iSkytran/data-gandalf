    "description": "#**Context**\nTechnology companies have become a dominant driver in recent years of economic growth, consumer tastes and the financial markets. The biggest tech stocks as a group, for example, have dramatically outpaced the broader market in the past decade.\n\n\ufeffThat's because technology has reshaped in a major way how people communicate, consume information, shop, socialize, and work.\n\nBroadly speaking, companies in the technology sector engage in the research, development, and manufacture of technologically based goods and services. They create software, and design and manufacture computers, mobile devices, and home appliances. They also provide products and services related to information technology.\n\n#**Content**\n\nThis dataset contains 3 files with the daily stock price and volume of the three companies: Google, Apple, and Facebook from 07/09/2017 to 07/09/2022.
