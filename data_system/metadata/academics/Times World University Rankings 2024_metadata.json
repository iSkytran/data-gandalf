    "description": "The **Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024** dataset include **1,904 universities across 108 countries and regions.**\n\nTHE (Times Higher Education) has been providing trusted performance data on universities for students and their families, academics, university leaders, governments and industry, since 2004. \n\n\nThe table is based on their new WUR 3.0 methodology, which includes 18 carefully calibrated performance indicators that measure an institution\u2019s performance across five areas: teaching, research environment, research quality, industry, and international outlook.\n\n\nThis year\u2019s ranking analysed more than 134 million citations across 16.5 million research publications and included survey responses from 68,402 scholars globally. Overall, we collected 411,789 datapoints from more than 2,673 institutions that submitted data.\n\n\nTrusted worldwide by students, teachers, governments and industry experts, the 2024 league table reveals how the global higher education landscape is shifting.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford tops the ranking for the eighth year in a row, but others in the top five have seen shifts in their ranks. Stanford University moves up to second place, pushing Harvard University down to fourth.\n\n\nIn addition to the 1,904 ranked institutions, a further 769 universities are listed with \u201creporter\u201d status, meaning that they provided data but did not meet our eligibility criteria to receive a rank, and agreed to be displayed as a reporter in the final table.\n\nIf you want to know about the Methodology: [click here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/sites/default/files/the_2024_world_university_rankings_methodology.pdf)\n\n*Since you have reached till here, please consider **upvoting** if you find this dataset helpful*\n\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n- The Times World University Rankings 2024 raw data, image and content of the description is taken directly from 'THE' website https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings .\n- The dataset is uploaded for educational, research purpose, I do not claim to be original owner of the data\n",
