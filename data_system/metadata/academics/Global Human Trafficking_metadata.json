    "description": "# Abstract\n&gt; The largest dataset on human trafficking, with more 150 participant countries.\n\n# About this dataset\n&gt; Historically, it has been difficult to make data on human trafficking readily accessible to analysts, academics, practitioners and policy-makers. Data on human trafficking are often highly sensitive matter and at the same time it is widely recognized that one of the foremost challenges in developing targeted counter-trafficking responses and measuring their impact is the lack of reliable, high-quality information. \n\n&gt; To that end, the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) is the first global data hub on human trafficking, publishing harmonized data from counter-trafficking organizations around the world in order to equip the counter-trafficking community with up to date, reliable data on human trafficking. \n\n&gt; This dataset contains information on **48.8k** victims of human trafficking, including the reason, means of control, origin and destination, as well as other variables. Note that missingness is displayed as `-99` in this dataset.\n\n# How to use\n&gt;- Predict time series of human trafficking.\n- Explore demographics, means of control and other variables associated with human trafficking.\n- [More datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/datasets)\n\n# Acknowledgements\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\n@misc{ctdc, \ntitle={Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC)}, \nurl={https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/}, \njournal={CTDC}\n}\n\n&gt; ### License\nFree to use, download and derive so long as authors are credited.
