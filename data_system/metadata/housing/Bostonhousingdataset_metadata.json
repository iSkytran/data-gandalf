    "description": "### Context\n\nThis is a copy of the original [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing/overview).  As of December 2021, the original link doesn't contain the dataset so I'm uploading it if anyone wants to use it.\nI'll implement a linear regression model to predict the output 'MEDV' variable using PyTorch (check the companion notebook).\n\nI took the data given in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset/data) and processed it to include the column names as well.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset/data\n\n\n### Inspiration\nGood luck on your data science career :)",
