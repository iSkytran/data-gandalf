    "description": "I've always been a workout and fitness fanatic and now that I've learned about web scrapping, I want to try my new found skills in scrapping one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) online website for sports nutrition -- **bodybuilding.com**\n\nIn this attempt, I would like to create a dataset that has **all Sports Nutrition and Workout Support** products. Specifically my aim is to select the following features from each product:\n- Product name\n- Brand name\n- Product description\n- Product category\n- Total price\n- Price per serving\n- Number of reviews\n- Overall rating\n- Number of overall reviewers\n- Verified buyer rating\n- Number of verified buyer reviews\n- Average flavor rating\n- Number of flavors\n- Top rated flavor rating\n- Top rated flavor name\n\n**To Note:** this data set can be further enhanced by including other product properties, such as:\n- Ingredients\n- Different servings sizes and their corresponding prices\n- etc...\n\nHowever, due to time constraints and this being the first time I attempt to scrape a website, I will stick to the list I have currently :)\n\n## Potential questions to answer using this dataset\n\n- Which product categories are associated with the highest rating? As a potential product developer, which category should you focus on?\n\n- What flavor should the product you create make available? Does that make a difference? Do flavors affect overall product rating?\n\n- Does value affect overall product rating? Is price negatively correlated with overall product rating?\n\nThese and other potential questuons could be answered and/or alluded to using the available dataset. Happy coding pythonistas!!!",
