    "description": "\ud83d\udce2**April 18, 2023 Update ( Please use Version 2):**\n- Renamed \"profit\" to \"revenue\" for better understanding.\n- Normalized the values in Thai Baht (previously MTHB).\n\n---\n\nThis dataset contains statistics on domestic tourism in Thailand from Jan 2019 to Feb 2023, broken down by province. The dataset includes information on the number of tourists, the occupancy rate, and the profits generated by tourism in each province, as well as the nationality of the tourists (Thai vs. foreign). \n\nSourced from raw data provided by the [Official Ministry of Tourism and Sports Statistics](https://www.mots.go.th/news/category/411), which was manually entered into Excel files \ud83d\ude43. So I pre-processed the data using Python with the intention of making it more accessible in the appropriate format which has the potential to provide valuable insights into the domestic tourism industry in Thailand, including trends and patterns across different provinces over time. Researchers, analysts, and policymakers with an interest in the domestic tourism sector in Thailand may find this dataset useful for their work.\n\n**Banner credit**: Tourism Authority of Thailand. \n\n&gt; **Cleaned and ready-to-use** 77 Provinces, 8 Variables, 3 Years and 2 Months with total 30,800 rows.\n\n\n\n|Column\t|Description|\n| ---         | --- |\n|date\t|The month and year in which the statistics were recorded.
