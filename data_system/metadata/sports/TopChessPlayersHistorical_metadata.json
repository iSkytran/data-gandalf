    "description": "### Context\n\nRankings are a constant phenomenon in society, with a  persistent interest in the stratification of items in a set across various disciplines. In sports, rankings are a direct representation of the performance of a team or player over a certain period.  Given the straightforward nature of rankings in sports (points based system) there is the opportunity to statistically explore rankings of sports disciplines. \n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset comprises monthly rankings data of the Top 100 Chess players between July 2000 and June 2017 . The data is housed in a single csv file. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nData was sourced from the official site of the World Chess Federation: fide.com\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis dataset could be of use to anyone interested in the distribution of rankings in competitive events.",
