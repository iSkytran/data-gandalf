    "description": "The Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) is an American professional field lacrosse league, composed of 8 teams. The league's inaugural season debuted on June 1, 2019, and included a 14-week tour-based schedule taking place in 12 major-market cities. The PLL is headquartered in El Segundo, California.\n\nThe PLL was founded in 2018 by Michael Rabil, a former All-American lacrosse player at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the U.S. national team. Rabil's goal was to create a professional lacrosse league that would be more fan-friendly and accessible than the previous MLL. The PLL has several innovations that set it apart from other professional lacrosse leagues, including:\n\n* A tour-based schedule that takes the league to major markets across the United States.\n* A single-elimination playoff format that culminates in a championship weekend.\n* Create the two point goal line for lacrosse.\n* And much more.\n\nThe PLL has been a success since its inception. The league has attracted top players from the MLL and NCAA, and its games have been well-received by fans. The PLL has also been a financial success, and it has been praised for its innovative approach to professional lacrosse.\n\n* The current teams include:\n    * Archers LC\n    * Atlas LC\n    * Chrome LC\n    * Chaos LC\n    * Cannons LC\n    * Whipsnakes LC\n    * Waterdogs LC",
