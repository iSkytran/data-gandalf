    "description": "Inmediately after a rough Tokyo 2020 Olympics for Argentina, a question surrounds our heads: why some countries win more medals than others? Starting from this point, we consider four dimensions we believe have an impact in final medal pole. They are: national sports budget; population; host; genre equality. \n\nAlso we cuted time series to three years (2017-2019), considered as key years between previous and ultimate games.\n\nEurostat.com data availability guided us to compare European Union countries with Argentina status, establishing correlation levels for each dimension. Dataset is part of those efforts. In Argentina's case, we extracted data from a local digital journal (Infocielo.com). All values were converted from national currencies (Euro; Peso Argentino) to dollar for standardizing comparisons, querying Investing.com year averages.\n\nInterested?
