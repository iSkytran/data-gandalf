    "description": "The beer dataset contains 60 samples published by Norgaard et al. Recorded with a 30mm quartz cell on the undiluted degassed beer and measured from 1100 to 2250 nm (576 data points) in steps of 2 nm.\n\nA good playing ground for regression methods starting from spectral intensities. \n\n**References**\nNorgaard, L., Saudland, A., Wagner, J., Nielsen, J.
