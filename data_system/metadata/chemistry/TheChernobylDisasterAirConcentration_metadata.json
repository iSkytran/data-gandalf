It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven - the maximum severity - on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. Content This dataset presents concentration of Iodine-131 (I-131) and Caesium-134 (Cs-134) as anaerosol particles which were measured in specific location and date.\n\n<br>\n## Field Names and Descriptions\n\n| Field Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| PAYS | country abbreviation |\n| Code| country code |\n| Ville | locality name |\n| X | lattitude (degrees.hundredths of degrees) |\n| Y | longitude (degrees.hundredths of degrees) |\n| Date | date (year/month/day) |\n| End_of_sampling | hour of end of sampling (hours:minutes) |\n| Duration(h.min) | duration (hours.minutes) |\n| I_131_(Bq/m3) | I-131 concentration in Bq/m3 (aerosol particles) |\n| Cs_134_(Bq/m3) | Cs-134 concentration in Bq/m3 (aerosol particles) |\n| Cs_137_(Bq/m3) | Cs-137 concentration in Bq/m3 (aerosol particles) |\n\n<br>\n## Acknowledgements\n\n1.
