    "description": "Nuclear energy \u2013 alongside hydropower \u2013 is one of our oldest low-carbon energy technologies.\n\nNuclear power generation has been around since the 1960s but saw massive growth globally in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. In the interactive chart shown, we see how global nuclear generation has changed over the past half-century.\n\nFollowing fast growth during the 1970s to 1990s, the global generation has slowed significantly. In addition, we see a sharp dip in nuclear output following the Fukushima tsunami in Japan in 2011 as countries took plants offline due to safety concerns.\n\nBut we also see that in recent years, production has once again increased.\n\nThe global trend in nuclear energy generation masks the significant differences in its role at the country level.\n\nSome countries get no energy from nuclear \u2013 or are aiming to eliminate it \u2013 while others get the majority of their power from it.\n\nThis dataset shows the amount of nuclear energy generated by the country. France, the USA, China, Russia, and Canada all produce relatively large amounts of atomic power.",
