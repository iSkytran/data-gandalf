    "description": "Since the Industrial Revolution, the energy mix of most countries across the world has become dominated by fossil fuels. This has major implications for the global climate, as well as for human health. Three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions result from the burning of fossil fuels for energy. And fossil fuels are responsible for large amounts of local air pollution \u2013 a health problem that leads to at least 5 million premature deaths each year.\n\nTo reduce CO2 emissions and local air pollution, the world needs to rapidly shift towards low-carbon sources of energy \u2013 nuclear and renewable technologies.\n\nThis dataset is published by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy)\nHannah Ritchie, Max Roser and Pablo Rosado (2020) - \u201cRenewable Energy\u201d Published online at OurWorldInData.org.
