    "description": "About the dataset\nThe data points were collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011) when the power plant was set to work with a full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables - Ambient Temperature (AT), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant.\n\nA combined-cycle power plant uses both gas and a steam turbine together to produce up to 50 percent more electricity from the same fuel than a traditional simple-cycle plant. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra power.\n\nAll the UN Member States have to submit a report on the combined cycle power plant to the United Nations. The Power Plant officials of Mexico are devising a way to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant. You are appointed as the chief for this operation. Create a Machine Learning Model to solve this problem efficiently.",
