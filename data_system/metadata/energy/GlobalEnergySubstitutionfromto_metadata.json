    "description": "The energy system has transformed dramatically since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nIt is based on historical estimates of primary energy consumption from Vaclav Smil, combined with updated figures from BP's [Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html).\n\nNote that this data presents primary energy consumption via the 'substitution method'. The 'substitution method' \u2013 in comparison to the 'direct method' \u2013 attempts to correct for the inefficiencies (energy wasted as heat during combustion) in fossil fuel and biomass conversion. It does this by correcting nuclear and modern renewable technologies to their 'primary input equivalents' if the same quantity of energy were to be produced from fossil fuels.\n\n\n### Collected by:\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado and Max Roser (2020) - \"Energy Production and Consumption\".
