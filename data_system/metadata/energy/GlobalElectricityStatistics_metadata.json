    "description": "<br>\nThis dataset contains the **Yearly** data from **1980 to 2021** on world electricity statistics. The dataset has total of **4 features** and details of each feature is given below (All the information is in the **billion kWh** and **million kW**).\n\nIf you liked the data or find it interesting, a vote will be really helpful \u2764\ufe0f\n\n- My other data-card on [Global Energy Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhiljethwa/world-energy-statistics)\n- Starter Notebook [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akhiljethwa/starter-notebook-global-electricity-statistics)\n\n<hr>\n\n# Main Features:\n&gt; -  **Country**: Name of the Country\n&gt; -  **Region**: Region of the Country\n&gt; -  **Electricity Transaction**: Different 7 types of transactions/activity, details of which is given below. \n&gt; -  **Years**: Total 41 columns from year 1980 to 2021. \n\n# Electricity Activities/Transactions:\n&gt; -  **Net Generation (billion kWh)**: Electricity generation/production \n&gt; -  **Net Consumption (billion kWh)**: Electricity consumption\n&gt; -  **Imports (billion kWh)**: Electricity imports \n&gt; -  **Exports (billion kWh)**: Electricity exports\n&gt; -  **Net Imports (billion kWh)**: Electricity net imports\n&gt; -  **Installed Capacity (million kW)**: The maximum amount of electricity that a generating station (also known as a power plant) can produce under specific conditions designated by the manufacturer \n&gt; -  **Distribution Losses (billion kWh)**: Transmission and distribution losses refer to the losses that occur in transmission of electricity between the sources of supply and points of distribution. \n\n# Potential Use cases:\n&gt; -  **Time series analysis**: Time series analysis to find the different patterns in electricity production, consumption, imports, exports and etc.\n&gt; -  **Time series forecasting**: Time series forecasting to predict the electricity production and consumption in future.\n&gt; -  **Capacity**: Find the current statistics of capacity of power plants and forecast the future values.\n&gt; -  **Reduce Electricity Losses**: Analyzing patterns of distribution losses and finding methods to reduce that.\n\n# Important Note:\n&gt;- Dataset contains null values too and it might be possible that all the value will be in object datatype so you may need to convert it into int or float first :)\n\nCover Image from: https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth/how-old-is-the-earth/",
