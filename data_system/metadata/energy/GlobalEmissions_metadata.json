    "description": "## Context\nMethane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term global warming and improving air quality. The energy sector \u2013 including oil, natural gas, coal and bioenergy \u2013 accounts for nearly 40% of methane emissions from human activity.\n \n## Content\nThe following dataset has information about methane gas emissions globally. Details about the columns are as follows:\n1. region - \n2. country - Country of Emission.\n3. emissions - Methane Emissions in kt.\n4. type - Sector from which emissions occur.\n5.  Segment- Sub-sector from which emissions occur.\n6. reason - The reason for the emission.\n7. baseYear - Base year for the tracking of emissions.\n8. notes - The source of data",
