    "description": "## Context\nThe dataset featured below was created by reconciling measurements from [requests of individual weather attributes](https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/index.php) provided by the European Climate Assessment (ECA). The measurements of this particular dataset were recorded by a weather station near Heathrow airport in London, UK.\n\n-&gt; This weather dataset is a great addition to [this London Energy Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-homes-energy-data). You can join both datasets on the **'date'** attribute, after some preprocessing, and perform some interesting data analytics regarding how energy consumption was impacted by the weather in London.\n\n## Content\nThe size for the file featured within this Kaggle dataset is shown below \u2014 along with a list of attributes and their description summaries:\n- `london_weather.csv` - 15341 observations x 10 attributes\n\n1. **date** - recorded date of measurement - **(int)**\n2. **cloud_cover** - cloud cover measurement in oktas - **(float)**\n3. **sunshine** - sunshine measurement in hours (hrs) - **(float)**\n4. **global_radiation** - irradiance measurement in Watt per square meter (W/m2) - **(float)**\n5. **max_temp** - maximum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) - **(float)**\n6. **mean_temp** - mean temperature in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) - **(float)**\n7. **min_temp** - minimum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) - **(float)**\n8. **precipitation** - precipitation measurement in millimeters (mm) - **(float)**\n9. **pressure** - pressure measurement in Pascals (Pa) - **(float)**\n10. **snow_depth** - snow depth measurement in centimeters (cm) - **(float)**\n\n## Source\nWeather Data - https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/index.php",
