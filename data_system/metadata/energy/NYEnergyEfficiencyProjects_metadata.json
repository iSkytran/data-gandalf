    "description": "### Content  \n\nThe City\u2019s Long-Term Sustainability Plan, PlaNYC, calls for City government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by municipal operations 30% by 2017. A large part of this effort is retrofitting municipal buildings to become more energy efficient. This dataset lists energy efficiency projects at City buildings that are complete or in progress. Projects are listed by address, building name, and agency, and the dataset includes the estimated reduction in tons of GHG emissions associated with the project.  \n\n### Context  \n\nThis is a dataset hosted by the City of New York. The city has an open data platform found [here](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) and they update their information according the amount of data that is brought in. Explore New York City using Kaggle and all of the data sources available through the City of New York [organization page](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city)!  \n\n* Update Frequency: This dataset is updated quarterly.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is maintained using Socrata's API and Kaggle's API.
