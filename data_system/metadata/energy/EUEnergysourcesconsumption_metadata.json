    "description": "### Context\n\nThis dataset is part of a series that contains two other datasets:\n\n* [UN SDG - EU 27 sample datamart (subset for 7 KPIs)](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/sdgeu-datamart-sample)\n* [Selected Indicators from World Bank 2000-2019: 33 indicators from World Bank website for a data project](https://www.kaggle.com/robertolofaro/selected-indicators-from-world-bank-20002019)\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains 4 CSV files:\n| name | contents |\n| --- | --- |\n| EU27_FinalConsumptionBySector | consumption by sector |\n| EU27_SupplyProduction | production by source |\n| EU27_SupplyExport | export by source (note: the values are positive: if interested in obtaining the net amont available, should compute SupplyProduction - SupplyExport + SupplyImport |\n| EU27_SupplyImport | import by source |\n\nAs the original datasource was an Excel table, the data have been extracted as subset of the spreadsheet **EU27_2020** within the source *energy_statistical_countrydatasheets.xlsx*\n\nThe first column in each CSV file is the datapoint name, followed by data columns, one for each year 1990-2018.\n\n**Release date and timeframe coverage**\n\nThe collated dataset was released on 2020-11-25, and contains data from 1990 until 2018.\n\n**Source**\n\n* [information supporting the Statistical pocketbook 2020, data updated in August 2018](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/information-on-energy-markets-in-eu-countries-with-national-energy-profiles)\n* [EU energy in figures Statistical pocketbook 2020 - released on 2020-09-15](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/87b16988-f740-11ea-991b-01aa75ed71a1/language-en?WT.mc_id=Searchresult&WT.ria_c=37085&WT.ria_f=3608&WT.ria_ev=search)\n\nDescription from the source website:\n*\"The European Commission DG ENERGY produce on biannual basis the energy statistical datasheets. They contain an overview of the EU as a whole as well as individual country profiles, based on data from Eurostat and from the EU greenhouse gas monitoring mechanism. These datasheets cover the period between 1990 and the last year available in the European statistics and contain data on: energy balance, electricity production, heat production, cogeneration heat and power, energy markets indicators, transport fuels, main energy indicators, greenhouse gas emissions. They are arranged in a tabular ready-to-use format, and are a very useful tool for anyone, both experts and members of the general public, looking for fast access to statistical data on energy in the EU and its member countries.\"*\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to EU for publishing the extensive Open Data\n\n### Inspiration\n\nConnecting different data points to identify potential correlations, as part of my knowledge update/learning process (and to complement my other publication activities).\n\nAs [part of a long-term publishing project (started in 2015 at Expo2015 in Milan)](http://robertolofaro.com/index.php?section=expo2015diaries), routinely share data that collect along my writing journey- generally via articles on [my website on business and social change](https://robertolofaro.com).\n",
