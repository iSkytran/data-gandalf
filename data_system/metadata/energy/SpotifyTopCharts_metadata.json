The dataset include the following features:\n\nHighest Charting Position: The highest position that the song has been on in the Spotify Top 200 Weekly Global Charts in 2020 & 2021.\nNumber of Times Charted: The number of times that the song has been on in the Spotify Top 200 Weekly Global Charts in 2020 & 2021.\nWeek of Highest Charting: The week when the song had the Highest Position in the Spotify Top 200 Weekly Global Charts in 2020 & 2021.\nSong Name: Name of the song that has been on in the Spotify Top 200 Weekly Global Charts in 2020 & 2021.\nSong iD: The song ID provided by Spotify (unique to each song).\nStreams: Approximate number of streams the song has.\nArtist: The main artist/ artists involved in making the song.\nArtist Followers: The number of followers the main artist has on Spotify.\nGenre: The genres the song belongs to.\nRelease Date: The initial date that the song was released.\nWeeks Charted: The weeks that the song has been on in the Spotify Top 200 Weekly Global Charts in 2020 & 2021.\nPopularity:The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.\nDanceability: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\nAcousticness: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.\nEnergy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.\nInstrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.\nLiveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\nLoudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track. Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\nSpeechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.\nTempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\nValence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\nChord: The main chord of the song instrumental.\n\nAcknowledgements-\nThis dataset would not be possible without the help of spotifycharts.com and Spotipy Python Library\n",
