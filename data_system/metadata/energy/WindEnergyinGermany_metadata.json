    "description": "### Context\n\nThe goal of this dataset is to forecast wind power generation at a daily rate using different time series and traditional machine learning models.\n\n\n### Content\nThis dataset is pretty simple, It's a time series dataset containing measurements of daily temperature, wind production and capacity from 2017 to 2019.\n\nThe columns in the dataset are : \n* utc_timestamp : Time in UTC \n* wind_generation : Daily wind production in MW\n* wind_capacity : Electrical capacity of wind in MW\n* temperature : Daily Temperature in degrees C\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank OPSD for making this dataset available publicly.\nhttps://open-power-system-data.org/",
