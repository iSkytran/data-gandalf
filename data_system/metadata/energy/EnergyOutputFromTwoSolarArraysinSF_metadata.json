    "description": "Energy Output From Two Solar Arrays in San Francisco\nDescription\nThe data provide the energy output for several months from two roof-top solar arrays in San Francisco. This city is known for having highly variable weather, so while these two arrays are only about 1 mile apart from each other, the Inner Sunset location tends to have more fog.\n\nUsage\nsolar\nFormat\nA data frame with 284 observations on the following 3 variables.
