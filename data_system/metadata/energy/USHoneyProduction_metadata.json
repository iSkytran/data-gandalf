    "description": "Honey is the natural product made by bees\u2014one of our planet's most important species. Honey bees visit millions of blossoms in their lifetimes, making pollination of plants possible and collecting nectar to bring back to the hive to produce honey.\n\nHoney bees use honey as their primary energy source and their instinct is to make more than their colony needs. Beekeepers harvest the excess and bottle it for consumption, just like they\u2019ve been doing since the beginning of time. Harvesting honey is good for the bees and also part of what makes successful beekeeping businesses.\n\nThis dataset provides insights into honey production, demand, and supply across different states of America.
