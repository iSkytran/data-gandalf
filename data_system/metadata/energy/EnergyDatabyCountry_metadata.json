    "description": "### Context\n\nDataset created as part of a Web Scraping project hosted on my GitHub repository [worldometers_crawler](https://github.com/Noeti/worldometers-crawler). On this repo you can find a description of how to use the Crawler. Please feel free to use it or comment on it, and suggest any change or improvement.\n\n\n### Content\n\nAll data comes from the [Worldometer website](https://www.worldometers.info/). I extracted only information related to Energy and CO2 emissions by country, but there is much more info available there (Environment, Water, Society & Media, Health, Food, Population, and Government & Economics). \n\nTo scrape the data in .json format I used my crawler. Additionally, I created a [script](https://github.com/Noeti/worldometers-crawler/blob/main/clean_dataset.ipynb) to process all JSON files, combine them, do some data cleaning, and output a CSV file.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to the website Worldometres(https://www.worldometers.info/).
