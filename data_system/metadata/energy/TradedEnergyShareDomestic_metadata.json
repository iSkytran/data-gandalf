    "description": "### Context\n\nThink about how much energy you use. Some common things come to mind: electricity to keep the lights on; heating to warm your home; the car or bus you might take to get to work.\n\nBut there\u2019s also the energy needed to produce the goods we buy in the first place. Sometimes these goods are produced in our own country \u2013 and so that energy is reported in our country\u2019s energy use data. But when we buy goods from overseas, this energy is included in their accounts. It\u2019s missing from ours.1\n\nWhen we compare energy use across the world we rarely adjust for the energy embedded in imports. But what happens when we do? What difference does it make to our energy footprint?\n\n### Content\n\nDatas come from ![https://ourworldindata.org/energy-offshoring](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-offshoring)\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n![https://d346xxcyottdqx.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/energy-markets.jpg](https://d346xxcyottdqx.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/energy-markets.jpg)\n\n### Inspiration\n\n- Which countries are exporters and importers of embodied energy?\n- How do production-based and consumption-based energy trends compare?\n- Where do people consume the most energy, after trade?\n",
