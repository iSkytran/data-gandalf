    "description": "### Context\n\nAs the world\u2019s population has expanded and gotten richer, the demand for food, energy and water has seen a rapid increase. Not only has demand for all three increased, but they are also strongly interlinked: food production requires water and energy; traditional energy production demands water resources; agriculture provides a potential energy source. This article focuses on the environmental impacts of food. Ensuring everyone in the world has access to a nutritious diet in a sustainable way is one of the greatest challenges we face.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains most 43 most common foods grown across the globe and 23 columns as their respective land, water usage and carbon footprints. \n\nColumns\n1. Land use change - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product \n2. Animal Feed - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n3. Farm   - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n4. Processing - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n5. Transport - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n6. Packaging - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n7. Retail - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n\nThese represent greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product) across different stages in the lifecycle of food production.\n\nEutrophication \u2013 the pollution of water bodies and ecosystems with excess nutrients \u2013 is a major environmental problem. The runoff of nitrogen and other nutrients from agricultural production systems is a leading contributor.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nhttps://ourworldindata.org\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\n1. Which types of food have more negative impact on the environment?\n2. What types of food production should be encouraged to consume nutritious diet in a sustainable way?\n3. Which stage of food production contributes more to the greenhouse gas emmision?\n4. Compare carbon footprint of plant-based foods?\n5. Compare carbon footprint of animal-based foods?\n6. Compare carbon footprint of protein rich foods?",
