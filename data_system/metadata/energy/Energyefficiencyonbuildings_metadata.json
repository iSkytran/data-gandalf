    "description": "Overview and summary\nThis report is based on the dataset available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency# and provides the raw data. Our interest in this dataset is to explore 3 interesting data points, and visualize how they are influencing the energy load.The dataset contains 8 input variables and 2 output variables (see variable information section).\n\nWe have figured that the Wall Area, Roof Area, Glazing Area are the key indicators and can influence the energy load efficiency for both (Heating and Cooling).\n\nVariable(s) Information:\nRelative Compactness\nSurface Area - m\u00b2\nWall Area - m\u00b2\nRoof Area - m\u00b2\nOverall Height - m\nOrientation - 2:North, 3:East, 4:South, 5:West\nGlazing Area - 0%, 10%, 25%, 40% (of floor area)\nGlazing Area Distribution (Variance) - 1:Uniform, 2:North, 3:East, 4:South, 5:West\nHeating Load - kWh/m\u00b2\nCooling Load - kWh/m\u00b2\n\nSource:\n\nThe dataset was created by Angeliki Xifara (angxifara '@' gmail.com, Civil/Structural Engineer) and was processed by Athanasios Tsanas (tsanasthanasis '@' gmail.com, Oxford Centre for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, University of Oxford, UK).\n\nRefs.\nCitation Request:\n\nA.
