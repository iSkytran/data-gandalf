With this dataset, I wanted to be able to answer some questions like:\n\n1. Which genres were more popular coming through 1950s to 2000s?\n2. Songs of which genre mostly saw themselves landing in the Top 2000s?\n3. Which artists were more likely to make a top song?\n4. Songs containing which words are more popular?\n5. What is the average tempo of songs compared over the years?\n6. Is there a trend of acoustic songs being popular back in 1960s than they are now?\n7. Is there a trend in genres preferred back in the day vs now?\n... and a lot more.",
