Power stations are generally connected to an electrical grid.\n\nMany power stations contain one or more generators, a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into three-phase electric power. The relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electric current.\n\nThe energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to generate electricity. Clean energy sources include nuclear power, and increasing use of renewables such as solar, wind, wave, geothermal, and hydroelectric.",
