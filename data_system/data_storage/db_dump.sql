This is a great book - I highly recommend!\n\nThe data is based on California Census in 1990.\n\n### About the Data (from the book):\n\n"This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from Luís Torgo's page (University of Porto). Luís Torgo obtained it from the StatLib repository (which is closed now). The dataset may also be downloaded from StatLib mirrors.\n\nThe following is the description from the book author:\n\nThis dataset appeared in a 1997 paper titled Sparse Spatial Autoregressions by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry, published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. They built it using the 1990 California census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).\n\nThe dataset in this directory is almost identical to the original, with two differences: \n207 values were randomly removed from the total_bedrooms column, so we can discuss what to do with missing data.\nAn additional categorical attribute called ocean_proximity was added, indicating (very roughly) whether each block group is near the ocean, near the Bay area, inland or on an island. This allows discussing what to do with categorical data.\nNote that the block groups are called "districts" in the Jupyter notebooks, simply because in some contexts the name "block group" was confusing."\n\n### About the Data (From Luís Torgo page): \nhttp://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/%7Eltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html\n\nThis is a dataset obtained from the StatLib repository. Here is the included description:\n\n"We collected information on the variables using all the block groups in California from the 1990 Cens us. In this sample a block group on average includes 1425.5 individuals living in a geographically co mpact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. W e computed distances among the centroids of each block group as measured in latitude and longitude. W e excluded all the block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables. T he final data contained 20,640 observations on 9 variables. The dependent variable is ln(median house value)."\n\n\n### End-to-End ML Project Steps (Chapter 2 of the book)\n\n1. Look at the big picture \n2. Get the data\n3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights\n4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms\n5. Select a model and train it\n6. Fine-tune your model \n7. Present your solution\n8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system\n\n# The 10-Step Machine Learning Project Workflow (My Version)\n\n1. Define business object\n2. Make sense of the data from a high level\n    - data types (number, text, object, etc.)\n    - continuous/discrete\n    - basic stats (min, max, std, median, etc.) using boxplot\n    - frequency via histogram\n    - scales and distributions of different features\n3. Create the traning and test sets using proper sampling methods, e.g., random vs. stratified\n4. Correlation analysis (pair-wise and attribute combinations)\n5. Data cleaning (missing data, outliers, data errors)\n6. Data transformation via pipelines (categorical text to number using one hot encoding, feature scaling via normalization/standardization, feature combinations)\n7. Train and cross validate different models and select the most promising one (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were tried in this tutorial)\n8. Fine tune the model using trying different combinations of hyperparameters\n9. Evaluate the model with best estimators in the test set\n10. Launch, monitor, and refresh the model and system\n	kaggle	{housing,regression}	{}	{dataset,x,y,longitude,latitude,housing_median_age,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income,median_house_value,ocean_proximity}	20684	13	206532	207	1
15	housing	California Housing Prices	### Context\n\nThis is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.\n\nThe data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.\n  \n### Content\n\nThe data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:\n\nlongitude\n\nlatitude\n\nhousing_median_age\n\ntotal_rooms\n\ntotal_bedrooms\n\npopulation\n\nhouseholds\n\nmedian_income\n\nmedian_house_value\n\nocean_proximity\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis data was initially featured in the following paper:\nPace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. "Sparse spatial autoregressions." Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.\n\nand I encountered it in 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow' by Aurélien Géron.\nAurélien Géron wrote:\nThis dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from:\n[Luís Torgo's page](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html) (University of Porto)\n\n### Inspiration\n\nSee my kernel on machine learning basics in R using this dataset, or venture over to the following link for a python based introductory tutorial: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/datasets/housing	kaggle	{"united states",housing,"real estate","social science","computer science",programming,software,"social issues and advocacy"}	{}	{longitude,latitude,housing_median_age,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income,median_house_value,ocean_proximity}	20640	10	206400	207	0.8529411764705882

11	housing	 Housing Market & Prices	## 🏡💰🏠Housing Market Data Attributes 🏠💰🏡\n\nIn the analysis of the housing market, it's essential to understand the various attributes that characterize each housing unit. These attributes provide valuable information for potential buyers, renters, and investors, helping them make informed decisions about their housing choices. Below, we describe the key data attributes used in our housing market analysis:\n\n- **Bedroom Count:** This attribute represents the number of bedrooms in the housing unit, providing insights into its size and capacity.\n\n- **Net Square Meters (Net Sqm):** Net square meters refer to the total usable interior space within the housing unit, excluding common areas like corridors and stairwells. It quantifies the size of the property.\n\n- **Center Distance:** This attribute measures the distance of the housing unit from the central or downtown area of a city or town. It is a valuable metric for potential buyers or renters to assess proximity to urban amenities and activities.\n\n- **Metro Distance:** Metro distance indicates the distance between the housing unit and the nearest metro or subway station. This information is particularly useful for individuals who rely on public transportation for their daily commute.\n\n- **Floor:** The floor attribute specifies the level or story of the housing unit within the building, offering insights into its placement and accessibility within the structure.\n\n- **Age:** The age of the property represents the number of years since its construction or renovation. It plays a crucial role in assessing the condition of the property and potential maintenance requirements.\n\n- **Price:** Price is the cost associated with purchasing or renting the housing unit. It is a fundamental factor for individuals making housing decisions and can be influenced by various attributes such as bedroom count, size, location, and age.\n	kaggle	{business}	{}	{bedroom_count,net_sqm,center_distance,metro_distance,floor,age,price}	4308	7	30156	0	1

20	health	COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset	&gt; ### “Health requires healthy food."###\nRoger Williams (1603 – 1683)\n\n<br>\nIn the past couple months, we’ve witnessed doctors, nurses, paramedics and thousands of medical workers putting their lives on the frontline to save patients who are infected. And as the battle with COVID-19 continues, we should all ask ourselves – What should we do to help out? What can we do to protect our loved ones, those who sacrifice for us, and ourselves from this pandemic?<br>\nThese questions all relate back to the CORD-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge Task Question: [“What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?” ](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=587)\n<br>\nAnd my simple answer is : **We need to protect our families and our own healths by adapting to a healthy diet.**\n<br>\n\n### Inspiration and Research Objectives\n\nThe USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion recommends a very simple daily diet intake guideline: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruits, and 20% protein, but are we really eating in the healthy eating style recommended by these food divisions and balances?\n<br>\nIn this dataset, I have combined data of different types of food, world population obesity and undernourished rate, and global COVID-19 cases count from around the world in order to learn more about how a healthy eating style could help combat the Corona Virus. And from the dataset, we can gather information regarding diet patterns from countries with lower COVID infection rate, and adjust our own diet accordingly. \n<br>\nIn each of the 4 datasets below, I have calculated fat quantity, energy intake (kcal),  food supply quantity (kg), and protein for different categories of food (all calculated as percentage of total intake amount). I've also added on the obesity and undernourished rate (also in percentage) for comparison. The end of the datasets also included the most up to date confirmed/deaths/recovered/active cases (also in percentage of current population for each country). \n<br>\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n- Data for different food group supply quantities, nutrition values, obesity, and undernourished percentages are obtained from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO website ](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home) To see the specific types of food included in each category from the FAO data, take a look at the last dataset `Supply_Food_Data_Description.csv`.\n\n- Data for population count for each country comes from Population Reference Bureau [PRB website ](https://www.prb.org/)\n\n- Data for COVID-19 confirmed, deaths, recovered and active cases are obtained from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering [CSSE website ](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)\n\n- The USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion diet intake guideline information can be found in [ChooseMyPlate.gov](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/)\n\n*Note: I will update and push new versions of the datasets weekly.

21	health	Fetal Health Classification	# Abstract\n&gt; Classify fetal health in order to prevent child and maternal mortality.\n\n# About this dataset\n&gt; ## Context\nReduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress.\nThe UN expects that by 2030, countries end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.\n\n&gt; Parallel to notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality, which accounts for **295 000 deaths** during and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). The vast majority of these deaths **(94%)** occurred in low-resource settings, and most **could have been prevented**.\n\n&gt; In light of what was mentioned above, **Cardiotocograms (CTGs)** are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n\n&gt; ## Data\nThis dataset contains **2126** records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into **3 classes**:\n- Normal\n- Suspect\n- Pathological\n\n\n# How to use\n&gt; - Create a multiclass model to classify CTG features into the three fetal health states.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\nAyres de Campos et al.

25	health	Mental Health and Suicide Rates	### Context\n\nClose to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide.\n\nSuicide is a complex issue and therefore suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defense, politics, and the media. These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated as no single approach alone can make an impact on an issue as complex as suicide.\n\n### Do leave an upvote if you found this dataset useful!	kaggle	{"mental health"}	{}	{}	1317	29	10210	253	1

Extremely complex underwriting rule-sets that are radically different in different product lines, many non-KYC environments with a lack of centralized customer information base, complex relationship with consumers in traditional risk underwriting where sometimes customer centricity runs reverse to business profit, inertia of regulatory compliance  - are some of the unique challenges faced by Insurance Business.\n\nDespite this, emergent technologies like AI and Block Chain have brought a radical change in Insurance, and Data Analytics sits at the core of this transformation. We can identify 4 key factors behind the emergence of Analytics as a crucial part of InsurTech:\n\n - **Big Data:** The explosion of unstructured data in the form of images, videos, text, emails, social media\n - **AI:** The recent advances in Machine Learning and Deep Learning that can enable businesses to gain insight, do predictive analytics and build cost and time - efficient innovative solutions\n - **Real time Processing:** Ability of real time information processing through various data feeds (for ex. social media, news)\n - **Increased Computing Power:** a complex ecosystem of new analytics vendors and solutions that enable carriers to combine data sources, external insights, and advanced modeling techniques in order to glean insights that were not possible before.\n\nThis dataset can be helpful in a simple yet illuminating study in understanding the risk underwriting in Health Insurance, the interplay of various attributes of the insured and see how they affect the insurance premium.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains 1338 rows of insured data, where the Insurance charges are given against the following attributes of the insured: Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoker and Region. There are no missing or undefined values in the dataset.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis relatively simple dataset should be an excellent starting point for EDA, Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis testing and training Linear Regression models for predicting Insurance Premium Charges.\n\nProposed Tasks:\n - Exploratory Data Analytics\n - Statistical hypothesis testing\n - Statistical Modeling\n - Linear Regression	kaggle	{finance,insurance}	{}	{}	1338	7	9366	0	0.9411764705882353

Data on human trafficking are often highly sensitive matter and at the same time it is widely recognized that one of the foremost challenges in developing targeted counter-trafficking responses and measuring their impact is the lack of reliable, high-quality information. \n\n&gt; To that end, the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) is the first global data hub on human trafficking, publishing harmonized data from counter-trafficking organizations around the world in order to equip the counter-trafficking community with up to date, reliable data on human trafficking. \n\n&gt; This dataset contains information on **48.8k** victims of human trafficking, including the reason, means of control, origin and destination, as well as other variables. Note that missingness is displayed as `-99` in this dataset.\n\n# How to use\n&gt;- Predict time series of human trafficking.\n- Explore demographics, means of control and other variables associated with human trafficking.\n- [More datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/datasets)\n\n# Acknowledgements\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\n@misc{ctdc, \ntitle={Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC)}, \nurl={https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/}, \njournal={CTDC}\n}\n\n&gt; ### License\nFree to use, download and derive so long as authors are credited.

45	academics	Student skillset analysis	Data under analysis belongs to undergraduate students, who are pursuing bachelor's in technology. The four-year course produces a major technically sound workforce which boost up the service sector. Being a major contributor to the service sector, the students must have a technically sound skillset which can land them into companies without much struggle.\nThe skillset required as per the jobs are different as per the role, but few factors contribute to each skillset. These factors and their corelation will be studied in the research. Several hypotheses will be considered from observations of the data, which will be tested using statistical tests for rejection/non rejection.\n\nThe Team: @manasrai1406 @hellomishraa @harveernarwar @Khushiarora123 @Shivang2003 @gar414 @VIKAS_GENISYSs	kaggle	{"universities and colleges",education,"computer science"}	{}	{"Unnamed: 0",2.Gender,"3.

46	academics	Survey Academics 	\nto cite this data set: J. Berengueres and P. Nesterov, “A Survey of H-index, Stress, Tenure & Reference Management software use in Academia.”  https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00358v3 https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00358v3 \n\n### Survey\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmphRiVkyiPsGYd4zka6aDaOI-GgftbktoLvdqNjjfY_KabA/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\n### Context\n\nRecommendation feeds are already found in the likes of GoogleScholarTM and ResearchGateTM. However, given the popularization of these tools, it is worth considering their impact on research and researchers. Surprisingly, very little is known about the impact of these tools on academic performance, productivity or well-being of their users. Are academics that use reference management tools more productive? Are they happier? A literature search yields very few results. [12] evaluated ethical conflicts of interest found in Google Scholar algorithms; [13] compared the existing tools; [14] investigated how ResearchGate metrics can be used to infer the performance of a researcher. However, none considers the well-being of researchers.\n\n### Content\n\nData of the survey was collected from 2020-07-09 to 2020-09- 28. The data was generated by emailing authors who had authored or co-authored at least one paper in a popular preprint server service in the past 3 years (Arxiv)[15]. In total, 2286 responses were collected. The survey consisted of 10 questions. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Cenk Dominic Özbakır for technical support and to the participants in the survey. In particular the ones whose feedback helped improve the design of the survey.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nYour data will be in front of the world's largest data science community.
