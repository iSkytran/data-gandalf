257	academics	Global Human Trafficking	# Abstract\n&gt; The largest dataset on human trafficking, with more 150 participant countries.\n\n# About this dataset\n&gt; Historically, it has been difficult to make data on human trafficking readily accessible to analysts, academics, practitioners and policy-makers. Data on human trafficking are often highly sensitive matter and at the same time it is widely recognized that one of the foremost challenges in developing targeted counter-trafficking responses and measuring their impact is the lack of reliable, high-quality information. \n\n&gt; To that end, the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) is the first global data hub on human trafficking, publishing harmonized data from counter-trafficking organizations around the world in order to equip the counter-trafficking community with up to date, reliable data on human trafficking. \n\n&gt; This dataset contains information on **48.8k** victims of human trafficking, including the reason, means of control, origin and destination, as well as other variables. Note that missingness is displayed as `-99` in this dataset.\n\n# How to use\n&gt;- Predict time series of human trafficking.\n- Explore demographics, means of control and other variables associated with human trafficking.\n- [More datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/datasets)\n\n# Acknowledgements\nIf you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\n@misc{ctdc, \ntitle={Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC)}, \nurl={https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/}, \njournal={CTDC}\n}\n\n&gt; ### License\nFree to use, download and derive so long as authors are credited.

However, given the popularization of these tools, it is worth considering their impact on research and researchers. Surprisingly, very little is known about the impact of these tools on academic performance, productivity or well-being of their users. Are academics that use reference management tools more productive? Are they happier? A literature search yields very few results. [12] evaluated ethical conflicts of interest found in Google Scholar algorithms; [13] compared the existing tools; [14] investigated how ResearchGate metrics can be used to infer the performance of a researcher. However, none considers the well-being of researchers.\n\n### Content\n\nData of the survey was collected from 2020-07-09 to 2020-09- 28. The data was generated by emailing authors who had authored or co-authored at least one paper in a popular preprint server service in the past 3 years (Arxiv)[15]. In total, 2286 responses were collected. The survey consisted of 10 questions. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank Cenk Dominic Özbakır for technical support and to the participants in the survey.

263	housing	 Housing Market & Prices	## 🏡💰🏠Housing Market Data Attributes 🏠💰🏡\n\nIn the analysis of the housing market, it's essential to understand the various attributes that characterize each housing unit. These attributes provide valuable information for potential buyers, renters, and investors, helping them make informed decisions about their housing choices. Below, we describe the key data attributes used in our housing market analysis:\n\n- **Bedroom Count:** This attribute represents the number of bedrooms in the housing unit, providing insights into its size and capacity.\n\n- **Net Square Meters (Net Sqm):** Net square meters refer to the total usable interior space within the housing unit, excluding common areas like corridors and stairwells. It quantifies the size of the property.\n\n- **Center Distance:** This attribute measures the distance of the housing unit from the central or downtown area of a city or town. It is a valuable metric for potential buyers or renters to assess proximity to urban amenities and activities.\n\n- **Metro Distance:** Metro distance indicates the distance between the housing unit and the nearest metro or subway station. This information is particularly useful for individuals who rely on public transportation for their daily commute.\n\n- **Floor:** The floor attribute specifies the level or story of the housing unit within the building, offering insights into its placement and accessibility within the structure.\n\n- **Age:** The age of the property represents the number of years since its construction or renovation. It plays a crucial role in assessing the condition of the property and potential maintenance requirements.\n\n- **Price:** Price is the cost associated with purchasing or renting the housing unit. It is a fundamental factor for individuals making housing decisions and can be influenced by various attributes such as bedroom count, size, location, and age.\n	kaggle	{business}	{other}	{bedroom_count,net_sqm,center_distance,metro_distance,floor,age,price}	4308	7	30156	0	1

This is a great book - I highly recommend!\n\nThe data is based on California Census in 1990.\n\n### About the Data (from the book):\n\n"This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from Luís Torgo's page (University of Porto). Luís Torgo obtained it from the StatLib repository (which is closed now). The dataset may also be downloaded from StatLib mirrors.\n\nThe following is the description from the book author:\n\nThis dataset appeared in a 1997 paper titled Sparse Spatial Autoregressions by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry, published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. They built it using the 1990 California census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).\n\nThe dataset in this directory is almost identical to the original, with two differences: \n207 values were randomly removed from the total_bedrooms column, so we can discuss what to do with missing data.\nAn additional categorical attribute called ocean_proximity was added, indicating (very roughly) whether each block group is near the ocean, near the Bay area, inland or on an island. This allows discussing what to do with categorical data.\nNote that the block groups are called "districts" in the Jupyter notebooks, simply because in some contexts the name "block group" was confusing."\n\n### About the Data (From Luís Torgo page): \nhttp://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/%7Eltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html\n\nThis is a dataset obtained from the StatLib repository. Here is the included description:\n\n"We collected information on the variables using all the block groups in California from the 1990 Cens us. In this sample a block group on average includes 1425.5 individuals living in a geographically co mpact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. W e computed distances among the centroids of each block group as measured in latitude and longitude. W e excluded all the block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables. T he final data contained 20,640 observations on 9 variables. The dependent variable is ln(median house value)."\n\n\n### End-to-End ML Project Steps (Chapter 2 of the book)\n\n1. Look at the big picture \n2. Get the data\n3.

266	housing	California Housing Prices	### Context\n\nThis is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.\n\nThe data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.\n  \n### Content\n\nThe data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required!

272	health	COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset	&gt; ### “Health requires healthy food."###\nRoger Williams (1603 – 1683)\n\n<br>\nIn the past couple months, we’ve witnessed doctors, nurses, paramedics and thousands of medical workers putting their lives on the frontline to save patients who are infected. And as the battle with COVID-19 continues, we should all ask ourselves – What should we do to help out? What can we do to protect our loved ones, those who sacrifice for us, and ourselves from this pandemic?<br>\nThese questions all relate back to the CORD-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge Task Question: [“What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?” ](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=587)\n<br>\nAnd my simple answer is : **We need to protect our families and our own healths by adapting to a healthy diet.**\n<br>\n\n### Inspiration and Research Objectives\n\nThe USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion recommends a very simple daily diet intake guideline: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruits, and 20% protein, but are we really eating in the healthy eating style recommended by these food divisions and balances?\n<br>\nIn this dataset, I have combined data of different types of food, world population obesity and undernourished rate, and global COVID-19 cases count from around the world in order to learn more about how a healthy eating style could help combat the Corona Virus. And from the dataset, we can gather information regarding diet patterns from countries with lower COVID infection rate, and adjust our own diet accordingly. \n<br>\nIn each of the 4 datasets below, I have calculated fat quantity, energy intake (kcal),  food supply quantity (kg), and protein for different categories of food (all calculated as percentage of total intake amount). I've also added on the obesity and undernourished rate (also in percentage) for comparison. The end of the datasets also included the most up to date confirmed/deaths/recovered/active cases (also in percentage of current population for each country). \n<br>\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n- Data for different food group supply quantities, nutrition values, obesity, and undernourished percentages are obtained from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO website ](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home) To see the specific types of food included in each category from the FAO data, take a look at the last dataset `Supply_Food_Data_Description.csv`.\n\n- Data for population count for each country comes from Population Reference Bureau [PRB website ](https://www.prb.org/)\n\n- Data for COVID-19 confirmed, deaths, recovered and active cases are obtained from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering [CSSE website ](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)\n\n- The USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion diet intake guideline information can be found in [ChooseMyPlate.gov](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/)\n\n*Note: I will update and push new versions of the datasets weekly.

273	health	Fetal Health Classification	# Abstract\n&gt; Classify fetal health in order to prevent child and maternal mortality.\n\n# About this dataset\n&gt; ## Context\nReduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress.\nThe UN expects that by 2030, countries end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.\n\n&gt; Parallel to notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality, which accounts for **295 000 deaths** during and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). The vast majority of these deaths **(94%)** occurred in low-resource settings, and most **could have been prevented**.\n\n&gt; In light of what was mentioned above, **Cardiotocograms (CTGs)** are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n\n&gt; ## Data\nThis dataset contains **2126** records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into **3 classes**:\n- Normal\n- Suspect\n- Pathological\n\n\n# How to use\n&gt; - Create a multiclass model to classify CTG features into the three fetal health states.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\nAyres de Campos et al.

278	health	Mental Health	Mental health is an essential part of people’s lives and society. Poor mental health affects our well-being, our ability to work, and our relationships with friends, family, and community.\n\nMental health conditions are not uncommon. Hundreds of millions suffer from them yearly, and many more do over their lifetimes. It’s estimated that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men will experience major depression in their lives. Other conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are less common but still have a large impact on people’s lives.\n\n**Mental health data based on surveys**\nAside from the formal diagnoses, mental illnesses can be measured using surveys and screening questionnaires.\nThese tend to ask people about symptoms similar to those in diagnostic manuals, but they can be used more easily and widely because the data does not need to be collected by a healthcare professional.\n\n**What are the strengths and limitations of survey data?**\nStrengths of survey data\nSurvey data on mental health has two major strengths.\nFirst, it involves structured interviews – people are asked a consistent set of questions regardless of their interviewer. This helps to ensure the data is more comparable between interviewers and across time.12\nSecond, surveys include a much wider range of people in the population, including those who would not seek treatment due to a lack of awareness, costs, or other concerns.\n\nLimitations of survey data\n\nThere are also several limitations of survey data to keep in mind.\nOne is that people may not share their symptoms in surveys, as they may not feel comfortable sharing them with researchers. Along with this, people’s comfort in sharing mental health symptoms may vary between countries and over time.16\nAnother limitation is that people may not remember their symptoms, especially when they are asked to recall symptoms in their lifetime so far. This can be challenging for older people whose symptoms may have occurred decades ago.\n\nBy Saloni Dattani	kaggle	{"mental health"}	{other}	{Entity,Code,Year,"Schizophrenia disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Depressive disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Anxiety disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Bipolar disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Eating disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Depressive disorders","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Schizophrenia","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Bipolar disorder","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Eating disorders","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Anxiety disorders","Major depression","Bipolar disorder","Eating disorders",Dysthymia,Schizophrenia,"Anxiety disorders","Potentially adequate treatment, conditional","Other treatments, conditional","Untreated, conditional","Nearly every day","More than half the days","Several days","Not at all","Number of countries with primary data on prevalence of mental disorders"}	13355	46	106652	1034	0.7058823529411765

MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.\n\nHowever, MT employs a wide range of different genres, varying from one organization to the next.\n\nThe **MxMH** dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind.\n\n# Interpreting data\n\n### Block 0: Background\nRespondents answer generic questions focused on musical background and listening habits.\n\n### Block 1: Music genres\nRespondents rank how often they listen to 16 music genres, where they can select:\n* Never\n* Rarely\n* Sometimes\n* Very frequently\n\n### Block 2: Mental health\nRespondents rank Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD on a scale of 0 to 10, where:\n* 0 - I do not experience this.\n* 10 - I experience this regularly, constantly/or to an extreme.\n\n*Additional data that does not fall in these blocks may provide useful background information. See column descriptors.*\n\n# Data collection\nData collection was managed by @catherinerasgaitis via a Google Form. Respondents were not restricted by age or location.\n\nThe form was posted in various Reddit forums, Discord servers, and social media platforms. Posters and "business cards" were also used to advertise the form in libraries, parks, and other public locations.\n\nThe form was relatively brief so that respondents would be more likely finish the survey.
