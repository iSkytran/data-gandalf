78	sports	IPL Dataset 2008-2016	**The Indian Premier League (IPL**) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India. It is one of the most popular and lucrative cricket leagues in the world. The tournament was established by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007 and is played every year during the months of March, April, and May.\n\nThe IPL follows a franchise-based model, where eight teams representing different cities or regions in India compete against each other. The teams are owned by various individuals, companies, and consortiums, including Bollywood actors, business tycoons, and corporate entities. Some of the prominent teams in the IPL include the Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings, Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nThe IPL has a star-studded lineup of players, with both international and domestic cricketers participating in the tournament. Many of the world's top cricketers, such as Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, AB de Villiers, and Chris Gayle, have been a part of the IPL. The league has provided a platform for young talents to showcase their skills and has played a significant role in the development of Indian cricket.\n\nThe tournament format involves a round-robin group stage followed by playoffs. Each team plays a total of 14 matches, facing every other team twice, once at home and once away. The top four teams in the group stage advance to the playoffs, which consist of the qualifier matches and the final. The team that finishes first in the group stage gets two chances to reach the final, while the other three teams compete in the eliminator and the second qualifier matches.\n\nThe IPL has witnessed intense rivalries, thrilling matches, and high-scoring contests over the years. The league has also been a platform for innovation in cricket, with features like strategic time-outs, cheerleaders, and the introduction of the Decision Review System (DRS) in the league before it was implemented globally.\n\nApart from the cricketing action, the IPL has become a significant entertainment spectacle, attracting a large fan base. The matches are held in various cricket stadiums across India, with fans supporting their favorite teams with enthusiasm and passion. The league has also been associated with glitz, glamour, and celebrity performances, making it a blend of sports and entertainment.\n\nThe IPL's success has led to the emergence of similar leagues in other countries, such as the Big Bash League in Australia and the Caribbean Premier League. It has also contributed to the growth of franchise-based sports leagues worldwide.\n\nOverall, the Indian Premier League has revolutionized cricket in India and has become a global phenomenon, attracting players, fans, and sponsors from around the world. It has provided a platform for top-level cricket, entertainment, and commercial opportunities, making it a highly anticipated and celebrated event in the cricket calendar.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/ipl-dataset-2008-2016	{football,cricket}	{"ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL)"}	{season,city,team1,team2,toss_winner,toss_decision,result,dl_applied,winner,win_by_runs,win_by_wickets,player_of_match,venue,umpire1,umpire2,umpire3}	577	16	9232	590	1

It is intended to provide an overview of the relative athleticism required across a variety of different competitive sports and can be used to identify which physical attributes are most important in each sport. \n> \n> To use this dataset, you will need to understand what the different sports measured by this data set represent. Sports like skiing, boxing, wrestling, and football all require very different mental and physical abilities in order to compete successfully. For example, Alpine Skiing will require greater skill related to speed, agility and power than Cross Country running does; while Swimming may rely more heavily on durability than Football does. Once familiar with the included sports then it becomes easier to utilize the scores assigned for each skill in order identify which skills might benefit a particular athlete most when considering a new athletic challenge. \n> \n> The dataset also provides useful information about how difficult it might be for any one individual athlete or competitor if they were looking at taking up one particular sport from scratch versus another with similar momentum when compared in terms of its overall scores across 10 areas relating specifically as they relate athletics. This could help indicate whether that athlete has a better chance or worse chance when competing against others who may have trained in or specialised within their chosen field longer or shorter than themselves respectively before stepping onto this same playing field together; simply by comparing total Athletics Skill Demand (ASD) Numbers over between both their desired sporting choices (the higher number representing higher difficulty). \n> \n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Identifying the most requested athletic traits by sport. By analyzing the data, one can uncover patterns within certain sports that require certain skills or abilities more than others.\n> - Determining which sports offer the best opportunity for balance and development of all skillsets by athletes. Specifically, this dataset could be used to identify which sports encourage holistic athletic development and what combination of skill demands those particular sports have in common.\n> - Developing an optimal training program for athletes interested in perfecting their craft in a particular sport by geotargeting regions with more advanced competition based on their specific skill needs relative to that region’s average competition level as demonstrated by this dataset\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/coreyhermanson)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **Unknown License - Please check the dataset description for more information.**\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: toughestsport.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                                              |\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|\n| **SPORT**     | Name of the sport.

278	housing	Housing in London	***Update 29-04-2020:*** The data is now split into two files based on the variable collection frequency (monthly and yearly). Additional variables added: area size in hectares, number of jobs in the area, number of people living in the area.\n\n### Context\nI have been inspired by [Xavier](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos) and his work on [Barcelona](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/discovering-barcelona-part-i) to explore the city of London! 🇬🇧 💂\n\n### Content\nThe datasets is primarily centered around the housing market of London. However, it contains a lot of additional relevant data: \n- Monthly average house prices\n- Yearly number of houses\n- Yearly number of houses sold\n- Yearly percentage of households that recycle\n- Yearly life satisfaction\n- Yearly median salary of the residents of the area \n- Yearly mean salary of the residents of the area \n- Monthly number of crimes committed \n- Yearly number of jobs\n- Yearly number of people living in the area\n- Area size in hectares \n\nThe data is split by areas of London called boroughs (a flag exists to identify these), but some of the variables have other geographical UK regions for reference (like England, North East, etc.). There have been no changes made to the data except for melting it into a long format from the original tables. \n\n### Acknowledgements\nThe data has been extracted from [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/). It is released under [UK Open Government License v2 and v3](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

Starting in 2003, colleges and universities in NCAA Division I — the largest and highest profile athletics programs — implemented a comprehensive academic reform package designed to improve the academic success and graduation of all student-athletes. The centerpiece of the academic reform package was the development of a real-time academic measurement for sports teams, known as the Academic Progress Rate (APR).\n\nThe APR includes student-athlete eligibility, retention and graduation as factors in a formula that yields a single number, providing a much clearer picture of the current academic culture on each Division I sports team in the country. Since its inception, the APR has become an important measure of student-athlete academic success. For high APR scores, the NCAA recognizes member institutions for ensuring that student-athletes succeed in the classroom. If, however, low APR scores are earned consistently, member institutions can be subjected to penalties including scholarship reductions and the loss of eligibility to compete in championships.\n\n\n# Content\n\nThis study was created, by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), to provide public access to team-level APR scores, eligibility rates, retention rates, and athlete counts on Division I athletic programs starting with the 2003-2004 season through the 2013-2014 season\n\n\n# Inspiration\n\nWhich sport or school has the highest academic score? Which schools' scores have increased or decreased significantly in the past decade? Are men's or women's team academic performance better?

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are normally held every four years, and since 1994, has alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year period.\n\nA medal ceremony is held after the conclusion of each Olympic event. The winner, and the second- and third-place competitors or teams, stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals by a member of the IOC. After the medals have been received, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country is played. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, assisting the officials who present the medals and acting as flag-bearers. In the Summer Olympics, each medal ceremony is held at the venue where the event has taken place, but the ceremonies at the Winter Olympics are usually held in a special "plaza". 	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/surajjha101/countries-olympics-medals-since-1896	{"water sports",global,sports,"exploratory data analysis","data visualization"}	{CC-BY-SA-3.0}	{"countries ","ioc_code ",summer_participations,summer_gold,summer_silver,summer_bronze,summer_total,winter_participations,winter_gold,winter_silver,winter_bronze,winter_total,total_participation,total_gold,total_silver,total_bronze,"total_total "}	156	17	2652	0	1

59	sports	Disney+ Hotstar Tv and Movie Catalog	Disney+ Hotstar (also known as Hotstar) is an Indian brand of subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned by Novi Digital Entertainment of Disney Star and operated by Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, both divisions of The Walt Disney Company.\n\nThe brand was first introduced as Hotstar for a streaming service carrying content from Disney Star's local networks, including films, television series, live sports, and original programming, as well as featuring content licensed from third-parties such as HBO and Showtime among others. Amid the significant growth of mobile broadband in India, Hotstar quickly became the dominant streaming service in the country.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Star India's parent company 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019, Hotstar was integrated with the company's new global streaming brand Disney+ as 'Disney+ Hotstar' in April 2020. The co-branded service added Disney+ original programming, and films and television series from its main content brands of Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and National Geographic alongside the domestic and third-party content already carried on the platform.\n\nOutside of India, the Disney+ Hotstar service also operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, which similarly combines entertainment content licensed from local, third-party studios, with the larger Disney+ library. Disney+ Hotstar is also expected to launch in the Philippines and Vietnam in the end of 2022. In Singapore, Canada, and the United Kingdom, Hotstar operates as a streaming service targeting overseas Indians, focusing on Disney Star's domestic entertainment and sports content; Disney+ operates as a standalone service in these markets. In 2021, Disney announced that it would discontinue the U.S. version of Hotstar in November 2021, in favor of adding its content to the domestic Hulu and ESPN+ services instead.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/goelyash/disney-hotstar-tv-and-movie-catalog	{"arts and entertainment","movies and tv shows",nlp,"recommender systems",tabular}	{CC-BY-SA-3.0}	{hotstar_id,title,description,genre,year,age_rating,running_time,seasons,episodes,type}	6874	10	68740	11442	1

75	sports	Independence and Interdependence in Sports	### Context\n\nThis is the dataset I created for my Bachelor's thesis in Sports Sciences. The purpose was finding differences in the self-construal (indepence vs interdependence) of people practicing team, individual and trend sports. \nI used an online questionnaire to gather the data. Self-construal was accessed using the Self-Construal-Scale (Singelis, 1994). This scale evaluates participants independence (from other people) and their interdepence (with other people) with 12 questions each. Apart from that, each participant had to identify their most important sport and how they perform it.\n\n### Content\n\nWhat's inside is more than just rows and columns. Make it easy for others to get started by describing how you acquired the data and what time period it represents, too.\n\n- **index** - number of completed questionnaire\n- **importance** - How important is sport for you? Scale 1-7\n- **sport** - With which sport do you identify the most?\n- **frequency** - How often do you practise any sport? Scale 1-8, 1 being less than once a week, 2 once a week, ..., 8 every day\n- **how_alone** - How do you prefer practising? Alone?\n- **how_small_groups** - How do you prefer practising? In small groups?\n- **how_big_groups** - How do you prefer practising? In big groups?\n- **independence** - mean value for independence from 1 to 7 (7 means highest independence)\n- **interdependence** - mean value for interdependence from 1 to 7 (7 means highest interdependence)\n- **sex** - gender of participant\n- **age** - age of participant\n- **education** - highest degree of education, scale 1-9\n\n### Inspiration\n\n- How do athletes from different sports differ in their independence/interdependence?\n- Are there differences according to gender, age, education or how they perform sports?\n- Is it sensible to group the athletes into team, individual and trend sports oder do you find a better classification?\n\nThis was the abstract of my thesis (Feld, 2014). Maybe you can also try to reconstruct the findings or try finding more interesting facts.\n\n&gt; Team, individual and trend sport athletes were compared to find differences in in-\ndependence and interdependence. Male and female athletes‘ results were evaluat-\ned seperatly from each other. The athletes had to complete a survey about their\nsport behavior including their most important sports and the Self-Construal-Scale to\nclassify them into their group and to obtain an individual score on each independ-\nence and interdependence. Differences were found in both independence and in-\nterdependence. Team sport athletes scored higher in independence than individual\nsport athletes. Trend sport athletes reached a higher score for interdependence\ncompared to the other athletes. Female trend sport athletes also proved to have a\nhigher interdependence than the other female groups. Furthermore, the study iden-\n1tified female athletes as more independent and less interdependent than male ath-\nletes. Other significant differences could not be found. However, a subsequent\nmoderation analysis showed that there exists a positive correlation between inter-\ndependence and importance of sports.\n\n### References\n\nFeld, H. (2014).

90	sports	Moneyball	### Context\n\nIn the early 2000s, Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta worked for the Oakland Athletics. While there, they literally changed the game of baseball. They didn't do it using a bat or glove, and they certainly didn't do it by throwing money at the issue; in fact, money was the issue. They didn't have enough of it, but they were still expected to keep up with teams that had much deeper pockets. This is where Statistics came riding down the hillside on a white horse to save the day. This data set contains some of the information that was available to Beane and DePodesta in the early 2000s, and it can be used to better understand their methods.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis data set contains a set of variables that Beane and DePodesta focused heavily on. They determined that stats like on-base percentage (OBP) and slugging percentage (SLG) were very important when it came to scoring runs, however they were largely undervalued by most scouts at the time. This translated to a gold mine for Beane and DePodesta. Since these players weren't being looked at by other teams, they could recruit these players on a small budget. The variables are as follows:\n\n- Team\n- League\n- Year\n- Runs Scored (RS)\n- Runs Allowed (RA)\n- Wins (W)\n- On-Base Percentage (OBP)\n- Slugging Percentage (SLG)\n- Batting Average (BA)\n- Playoffs (binary)\n- RankSeason\n- RankPlayoffs\n- Games Played (G)\n- Opponent On-Base Percentage (OOBP)\n- Opponent Slugging Percentage (OSLG)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis data set is referenced in The Analytics Edge course on EdX during the lecture regarding the story of Moneyball.\nThe data itself is gathered from baseball-reference.com.\nSports-reference.com is one of the most comprehensive sports statistics resource available, and I highly recommend checking it out.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nIt is such an important skill in today's world to be able to see the "truth" in a data set. That is what DePodesta was able to do with this data, and it unsettled the entire system of baseball recruitment. Beane and DePodesta defined their season goal as making it to playoffs. With that in mind, consider these questions:\n\n- How does a team make the playoffs?\n- How does a team win more games?\n- How does a team score more runs?\n\nThey are all simple questions with simple answers, but now it is time to use the data to find the "truth" hidden in the numbers.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/wduckett/moneyball-mlb-stats-19622012	{baseball}	{CC0-1.0}	{Team,League,Year,RS,RA,W,OBP,SLG,BA,Playoffs,RankSeason,RankPlayoffs,G,OOBP,OSLG}	1232	15	18480	3600	0.8235294117647058

In addition, it has basic box score statistics such as games played, average number of points, rebounds, assists, etc.\n\nThe pull initially contained 52 rows of missing data. The gaps have been manually filled using data from [Basketball Reference][1]. I am not aware of any other data quality issues. \n\n### Analysis Ideas\n\nThe data set can be used to explore how age/height/weight tendencies have changed over time due to changes in game philosophy and player development strategies. Also, it could be interesting to see how geographically diverse the NBA is and how oversees talents have influenced it. A longitudinal study on players' career arches can also be performed.   \n\n  [1]: https://www.basketball-reference.com/	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data	{basketball,sports,demographics}	{other}	{"Unnamed: 0",player_name,team_abbreviation,age,player_height,player_weight,college,country,draft_year,draft_round,draft_number,gp,pts,reb,ast,net_rating,oreb_pct,dreb_pct,usg_pct,ts_pct,ast_pct,season}	12844	22	282568	1854	1

For example, the United Kingdom does not offer specific medal bonuses but rather devoted approximately £345 million of government and lottery funds to Olympic and Paralympic sports for the Tokyo cycle, including roughly £61 million for “Athlete Performance Awards” (which are not based entirely on Olympic medals). The United States offers tiered monthly stipends offered to the United States national team, depending on pro, NCAA or high school status."\n\n Rewards were converted to USD\n\nhttps://swimswam.com/from-gold-to-green-olympic-medal-payouts-compared-by-nation/\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nArticle by MORGAN PRIESTLEY -July 10th, 2021\n\nhttps://swimswam.com/from-gold-to-green-olympic-medal-payouts-compared-by-nation/\n\nPhoto by Dave Kim on Unsplash\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe Olympic Games.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/mpwolke/cusersmarilonedriverea-de-trabalhomedalcsv	{"water sports",tabular}	{other}	{country;gold;silver;bronze;year}	19	1	19	0	1

180	education	Higher Education Institutions in the USA	# Higher Education Institutions in the United States&nbsp;of&nbsp;America Dataset\n\nThis repository contains a dataset of higher education institutions in the United States of America.\nThis dataset was compiled in response to a cybersecurity research of American higher education institutions' websites [1]. The data is being made publicly available to promote open science principles [2].\n\n## Data\n\nThe data includes the following fields for each institution:\n\n- Id: A unique identifier assigned to each institution.\n- Region: The federal state in which the institution is located.\n- Name: The full name of the institution.\n- Category: Indicates whether the institution is public or private.\n- Url: The website of the institution.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe dataset was obtained from the Higher Education Integrated Data System (IPEDS) website [3], which is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). NCES serves as the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing education-related data in the United States. The data was collected on February 2, 2023.\n\nThe initial list of institutions was derived from the IPEDS database using the following criteria: (1) US institutions only, (2) degree-granting institutions, primarily bachelor's or higher, and (3) industry classification, which includes: public 4 - year or above, private not-for-profit 4 years or more, private for-profit 4 years or more, public 2 years, private not-for-profit 2 years, private for-profit 2 years, public less than 2 years, private not-for-profit for-profit less than 2 years and private for-profit less than 2 years.\n\nThe following variables have been added to the list of institutions: Control of the institution, state abbreviation, degree-granting status, Status of the institution, and Institution's internet website address. This resulted in a report with 1,979 institutions.\n\nThe institution's status was labeled with the following values: A (Active), N (New), R (Restored), M (Closed in the current year), C (Combined with another institution), D (Deleted out of business), I (Inactive due to hurricane-related issues), O (Outside IPEDS scope), P (Potential new/add institution), Q (Potential institution reestablishment), W (Potential addition outside IPEDS scope), X ( Potential restoration outside the scope of IPEDS) and G (Perfect Children's Campus).\n\nA filter was applied to the report to retain only institutions with an A, N, or R status, resulting in 1,978 institutions. Finally, a data cleaning process was applied, which involved removing the whitespace at the beginning and end of cell content and duplicate whitespace. The final data were compiled into the dataset included in this repository.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis data is available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license and can be used for any purpose, including academic research purposes.

Understand the market trends and value of positions held within this system to help students prepare for their future career aspirations as well as empower employers with detailed data. This is an essential piece to have when looking into what fair compensation looks like in higher education and obtaining important insight regarding salary negotiation, wage structure, and workforce optimization\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; Welcome to this dataset on wage disparities in Pennsylvania's higher education system! This dataset contains salary information for employees of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) in 2013. You can use this information to uncover trends and differences in pay between different universities, departments, and job positions. \n&gt; \n&gt; Getting Started: \n&gt; - Open the file “2013_Salaries__Pennsylvania_State_System_of_Higher_Education.csv” and explore its contents. This dataset is composed of 8 columns: Name, Base Pay, University or Office, Position, Gender/Race/Ethnicity, Furlough Reduction % Reduction Days Number Total Pay Contract Type Max Probationary Step Payscale Group Admission Type Total Headcount Full-Time Employees Part-time employees and position code. \n&gt; - To begin your analysis you can start by identifying basic statistics about the data such as averages or counts for each column of data you are interested in such as salary range by university or office and job title groups such as deans versus other staff members . \n&gt; - Next identify which universities pay their staff the highest salaries? What kind of differences do you see across schools? Once you have identified key trends look into potential differences within each university using gender/race/ethnicity filters to identify wage disparities across demographic groups since unfortunately wage discrepancy still exists today even when controlling for variables like education experience seniority etc \n&gt; - Finally create graphs tables etc that present your findings effectively so that policy makers HR departments other stakeholders have a better insight into what changes need to be implemented so all personnel are treated equally with fair wages regardless of background! Good luck!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyze salary gaps between genders and positions to identify possible pay inequality, and to create true diversity in the workplace.\n&gt; - Track changes in base salaries over time for individual jobs or trends throughout a university/office over years.\n&gt; - Compare average annual salaries across different universities/offices within the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education; this information could be used to help inform decisions about where to work/study for prospective faculty and students alike!\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/education)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: 2013_Salaries__Pennsylvania_State_System_of_Higher_Education.csv**\n| Column name              | Description                                               |\n|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Name**                 | The name of the employee.

108	sports	Premier Lacrosse League Team Stats	The Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) is an American professional field lacrosse league, composed of 8 teams. The league's inaugural season debuted on June 1, 2019, and included a 14-week tour-based schedule taking place in 12 major-market cities. The PLL is headquartered in El Segundo, California.\n\nThe PLL was founded in 2018 by Michael Rabil, a former All-American lacrosse player at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the U.S. national team. Rabil's goal was to create a professional lacrosse league that would be more fan-friendly and accessible than the previous MLL. The PLL has several innovations that set it apart from other professional lacrosse leagues, including:\n\n* A tour-based schedule that takes the league to major markets across the United States.\n* A single-elimination playoff format that culminates in a championship weekend.\n* Create the two point goal line for lacrosse.\n* And much more.\n\nThe PLL has been a success since its inception. The league has attracted top players from the MLL and NCAA, and its games have been well-received by fans. The PLL has also been a financial success, and it has been praised for its innovative approach to professional lacrosse.\n\n* The current teams include:\n    * Archers LC\n    * Atlas LC\n    * Chrome LC\n    * Chaos LC\n    * Cannons LC\n    * Whipsnakes LC\n    * Waterdogs LC	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/premier-lacrosse-league-team-stats	{games,"united states",sports}	{CC0-1.0}	{season,team,wins,losses,scores_for,scores_against,score_differential,one_point_goals,two_point_goals,assists,shots,shot_percentage,x2_point_shots,x2_point_shot_pecentage,shots_on_goal,shots_on_goal_pecentage,turnovers,caused_turnovers,groundballs,faceoff_pecentage,faceoffs_won,faceoffs_lost,saves,save_percentage,penalties,penalty_minutes,power_play_pecentage,power_play_goals,power_play_shots,x2_point_goals_allowed,penalty_kill_pecentage,penalty_kills,playoff_notes}	29	33	957	0	1
109	sports	Pro and College Sports Lines	### Context\n\nAfter participating in many Kaggle competitions, we decided to open-source our Python AutoML framework [AlphaPy][1]. You can configure models using YAML, and it's a quick way to develop a classification or regression model with any number of [scikit-learn][2] algorithms. More importantly, we needed the ability to easily write custom transformations to engineer features that could be imported by other tools such as [H2O.ai][3] and [DataRobot][4], which are commercial AutoML tools.\n\nWe were very interested in predicting the stock market and sporting events, so we developed some tools for collecting end-of-day stock market data and then transforming that time series data for machine learning. For the sports data, we painstakingly entered game results on a daily basis, and this dataset (albeit limited) is the result. Sports APIs such as [Sportradar][5] are becoming more prevalent, but you still need a pipeline to merge all that data to shape it for machine learning.\n\n### Content\n\nWe collected game results, line, and over/under data for the following sports and seasons:\n\n - NFL 2014, 2015 (2 Seasons)\n - NBA 2015-16 (1 Season)\n - NCAA Football 2015-16 (1 Season)\n - NCAA Basketball 2015-16 (1 Season)\n\nUsing AlphaPy, we developed a sports pipeline to analyze trend data in the game results. You can find [documentation][6] and examples [here][7].\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nEvery speculator's dream is to gain an edge, whether it be betting on sports or speculating on stocks. This dataset is just a small step for applying machine learning to the world of sports data.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/ScottFreeLLC/AlphaPy\n[2]: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/\n[3]: https://www.h2o.ai/\n[4]: https://www.datarobot.com/\n[5]: https://developer.sportradar.com/\n[6]: http://alphapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[7]: http://alphapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/ncaab.html	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/scottfree/sports-lines	{basketball,sports,"computer science",gambling}	{CC0-1.0}	{season,date,away.team,away.score,home.team,home.score,line,over_under}	6652	32	53216	0	0.6470588235294118

114	sports	Sports Budget - Olympic Medals correlation	Inmediately after a rough Tokyo 2020 Olympics for Argentina, a question surrounds our heads: why some countries win more medals than others? Starting from this point, we consider four dimensions we believe have an impact in final medal pole. They are: national sports budget; population; host; genre equality. \n\nAlso we cuted time series to three years (2017-2019), considered as key years between previous and ultimate games.\n\nEurostat.com data availability guided us to compare European Union countries with Argentina status, establishing correlation levels for each dimension. Dataset is part of those efforts. In Argentina's case, we extracted data from a local digital journal (Infocielo.com). All values were converted from national currencies (Euro; Peso Argentino) to dollar for standardizing comparisons, querying Investing.com year averages.\n\nInterested?

122	sports	Sports nutrition supplements with ingredients	### Context\n\nThe dataset is related to sports nutrition supplements. The supplements commonly used is bodybuilding industry.\n\n\n### Content\n\nDataset consist of common details of a supplement. Previous dataset had missing ingredients. So the goal for this separate dataset was to include ingredients. Ingredients mentioned in labels vary a lot. Some supplements had blends of vitamins/minerals/proteins. The quantity of blend was specified as a whole so the ingredients of blend were not separated but exist in data set as a whole column that is why no. of columns and length of columns is very large. You can filter out these blend columns if you want, eg you may find a name of blend as:\nBlend Name = {ingredient1 ingredient2 ingredient3 ......}\n\nIf you find something that can be improved or how these blends can be improved in dataset, feel free to contact :)	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/daniyaljavaid/sports-nutrition-supplements-with-ingredients	{exercise,nutrition,health}	{unknown}	{Category,Name,Brand,Size,Flavor,Servings,Rating,FlavorRating,Reviews,Price,PricePerServing,CALORIES,"TOTAL FAT",CHOLESTEROL,SODIUM,"TOTAL CARBOHYDRATE",PROTEIN,CALCIUM,POTASSIUM,"DIETARY FIBER",IRON,"TOTAL SUGARS","VITAMIN D","VITAMIN D 0MCG",PHOSPHORUS,MAGNESIUM,"VITAMIN A","VITAMIN C","VITAMIN A (AS BETA-CAROTENE)","VITAMIN C (AS ASCORBIC ACID)","VITAMIN D (AS CHOLECALCIFEROL)","VITAMIN E (AS D-ALPHA TOCOPHEROL SUCCINATE)","THIAMIN (AS THIAMIN MONONITRATE)",RIBOFLAVIN,"NIACIN (AS NIACINAMIDE)","VITAMIN B6 (AS PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE)","FOLATE (AS FOLIC ACID)","VITAMIN B12 (AS CYANOCOBALAMIN)","BIOTIN (AS D-BIOTIN)","PANTOTHENIC ACID (AS D-CALCIUM PANTOTHENATE)","CHOLINE (AS CHOLINE BITARTRATE)","CALCIUM (AS CALCIUM CITRATE DICALCIUM PHOSPHATE)","IRON (AS FERROUS FUMARATE)","PHOSPHORUS (AS DICALCIUM PHOSPHATE DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE)","IODINE (AS POTASSIUM IODIDE)","MAGNESIUM (AS MAGNESIUM ASPARTATE)","ZINC (AS ZINC CITRATE)","SELENIUM (AS SELENOMETHIONINE)","COPPER (AS COPPER GLUCONATE)","MANGANESE (AS MAGNESIUM ASPARTATE)","CHROMIUM (AS CHROMIUM POLYNICOTINATE)","MOLYBDENUM (AS MOLYBDENIUM AMINO ACID CHELATE)","POTASSIUM (AS DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE)","CREATINE MONOHYDRATE",L-GLUTAMINE,INOSITOL,"PABA (PARA-AMINOBENZOIC ACID)","PROTEIN (AS WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE)","L-GLUTAMINE (FERMENTED)","BETAPOWER (BETAINE ANHYDROUS)","CREATINE HCL (PATENTED)","PROHYDROLASE (PROTEASE BLEND)","VITAMIN E","VITAMIN K",THIAMIN,NIACIN,"VITAMIN B6",BIOTIN,"PANTOTHENIC ACID",ZINC,SELENIUM,COPPER,MANGANESE,CHROMIUM,MOLYBDENUM,CHLORIDE,"BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACIDS = {(BCAAS) [FROM WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE L-LEUCINE L-VALINE L-ISOLEUCINE]}","MAGNESIUM (AS CITRATE)","SODIUM (AS CHLORIDE)","POTASSIUM (AS CITRATE)","ULTIMATE PROTEIN SYSTEM = {(MILK PROTEIN ISOLATE WHEY PROTEIN CONCENTRATE CALCIUM CASEINATE WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE MICELLAR CASEIN EGG WHITE L-ARGININE L-GLUTAMINE L-ISOLEUCINE L-LEUCINE L-VALINE)}","CALORIES FROM FAT","ULTIMATE MUSCLE PROTEIN SYSTEM = {(MILK PROTEIN ISOLATE WHEY PROTEIN CONCENTRATE CALCIUM CASEINATE WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE MICELLAR CASEIN EGG WHITE L-ARGININE L-GLUTAMINE L-ISOLEUCINE L-LEUCINE L-VALINE)}",PROHYDROLASE,"WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE (NON-DENATURED) = {(28.74 GRAMS WPI90 YIELDING 25 GRAMS OF COMPLETE PROTEIN)(CFM CROSS FLOW MICRO AND ULTRA-FILTERED.

It is a comprehensive collection of team and city data, including information about champions, runners-up, final four appearances, seasons competed in and other valuable insights. Analyzing this data can provide an inside look into why certain cities become titletowns through athletic success. This dataset sheds light on different eras, trends and milestones that demonstrate how sports have shaped our culture across time. With this data you can identify patterns over time to see which cities have been successful or which franchises have had a consistent presence throughout various leagues and eras. The data also offers perspective on how different players, teams or locals have contributed to achieving these titles and creating a standout sporting culture within their city or region\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides comprehensive information about the winningest cities in North American professional and NCAA sports. It includes details on the teams, sport, titles, finals, and final fours of each city based on data collected from 1920 to 2018. With this dataset, you can analyze the success of different cities living in North America and identify how many titles they have won over the years.\n>  \n> **Step 1:** Look at the data fields included in this dataset. The columns include key (unique identifier for each city), values (array of objects containing info about teams from that city), population (population of that city), seasons (array with information about seasons in which teams from th city competed), level_0 (index for each row), year (year of championship), sport (sport of championships), winner (winning team for each championship season), winner_metro(metro area for winning team) runner_up(runner up team for each cahmpionship season) runner_up_metro( me tro area fpr runner up tema) finalfour3( thirdteam itnhfinal four championship session) fiNalfour3Metroc maxotityfiegddamnssfnfore34ampxshipsd asfkvq8nearnaeffinalfoumdfvrmaxorityedteamder7thmcffinlafoursesson ) dfiniatfdovrfour4emtroeeramomnea afinthffonfe4 darmotionihffidftoamoeduaraofeimtdyivmpalityasp  icratttintThif5tmReBaayYOergucfienPlpouorrliainfnashinipitons .\n> \n> \n> **Step 2:** For a deeper analysis look into a specific title count by year using filters or search through single rows like those included in ‘case2’ json file to see detailed info regarding objects inside ‘teamArray’ where you can find out more information such as team name ,sport or league as well as array with titles etcetera. You can also use ‘seasons’ field contained inside case2 json files to look into years and list down all competing teams under that particular season giving us a better understanding which countries/teams were competing against one another over that period. \n>   \n> **Step 3:** To make comparison easier between cities don't forget to include metro area filters when searching otherwise you might not get\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - The dataset can be used to create an interactive web-based map showing the winningest cities in North American professional and NCAA sports by year. For example, users could hover over a city to see its total number of titles won, which sports it was won in, and details about the teams that won them. \n> - Data from this dataset can be used to publish a list of all-time greatest teams in each sport from North American professional and NCAA sports. This can then be filtered by metro area or city for an even deeper perspective into the greatest sporting franchises across North America over time. \n> - The dataset could also be used to compare titles won between different cities within one year, allowing people to look at two (or more) cities simultaneously and gain insight into how they fared competitively on each other in that season across all their respective sports championships/titles\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/dataworldadmin)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: case1.csv**\n| Column name    | Description                                                                                |\n|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **key**        | Unique identifier for each city.

568	energy	MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset	# MAGIC gamma telescope data 2004\n\n## Dataset Information.\n\n   The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy\n   gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the\n   imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays,\n   taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced\n   inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the\n   atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks\n   through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction\n   of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by\n   the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a\n   plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of\n   few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns\n   (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those\n   caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers\n   initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).\n\n   Typically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated\n   cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis\n   is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is\n   directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed\n   in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse.\n   If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be\n   an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse\n   (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be\n   used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric\n   along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination.\n   There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the\n   extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.\n\n   The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in \n      D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers,\n      Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).\n   The program was run with parameters allowing to observe events with energies down\n   to below 50 GeV.\n\n**Number of Instances:** 19020\n\n**Number of Attributes:** 11 (including the class)\n\n**Attribute information:**\n\n    1.  fLength:  continuous  -  major axis of ellipse [mm]\n    2.  fWidth:   continuous  - minor axis of ellipse [mm] \n    3.  fSize:    continuous  - 10-log of sum of content of all pixels [in #phot]\n    4.  fConc:    continuous  - ratio of sum of two highest pixels over fSize  [ratio]\n    5.  fConc1:   continuous  - ratio of highest pixel over fSize  [ratio]\n    6.  fAsym:    continuous  - distance from highest pixel to center, projected onto major axis [mm]\n    7.  fM3Long:  continuous  - 3rd root of third moment along major axis  [mm] \n    8.  fM3Trans: continuous  - 3rd root of third moment along minor axis  [mm]\n    9.  fAlpha:   continuous  - angle of major axis with vector to origin [deg]\n    10.  fDist:    continuous  - distance from origin to center of ellipse [mm]\n    11.  class:    g,h  - gamma (signal), hadron (background)\n\n**Missing Attribute Values: None**\n\n**Class Distribution:**\n\n      g = gamma (signal):     12332\n      h = hadron (background): 6688\n\n   For technical reasons, the number of h events is underestimated.\n   In the real data, the h class represents the majority of the events.\n\n   The simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, since\n   classifying a background event as signal is worse than classifying a signal\n   event as background. For comparison of different classifiers an ROC curve\n   has to be used. The relevant points on this curve are those, where the\n   probability of accepting a background event as signal is below one of the\n   following thresholds: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 depending on the required\n   quality of the sample of the accepted events for different experiments.\n\n\n## Sources:\n\n   (a) Original owner of the database:\n\n       R.

569	energy	 Magic Telescope dataset	Description\nAuthor: R. K. Bock. Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescope project (MAGIC)\nDonated by P. Savicky, Institute of Computer Science, AS of CR, Czech Republic\nSource: UCI\nPlease cite: Bock, R.K., Chilingarian, A., Gaug, M., Hakl, F., Hengstebeck, T., Jirina, M., Klaschka, J., Kotrc, E., Savicky, P., Towers, S., Vaicilius, A., Wittek W. (2004). Methods for multidimensional event classification: a case study using images from a Cherenkov gamma-ray telescope. Nucl.Instr.Meth. A, 516, pp. 511-528.\n\nThe data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).\n\nTypically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.\n\nThe data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, Corsika, described in: D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998). The program was run with parameters allowing to observe events with energies down to below 50 GeV.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/vstacknocopyright/magic-telescope-dataset	{"earth and nature"}	{other}	{id,ID,fLength:,fWidth:,fSize:,fConc:,fConc1:,fAsym:,fM3Long:,fM3Trans:,fAlpha:,fDist:,class:}	19020	13	247260	0	0.8823529411764706

The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\n\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.\n```	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/mental-health-care	{healthcare,"public health",health,"health conditions","jobs and career"}	{"U.S. Government Works"}	{Indicator,Group,State,Subgroup,Phase,"Time Period","Time Period Label","Time Period Start Date","Time Period End Date",Value,LowCI,HighCI,"Confidence Interval","Quartile Range","Suppression Flag"}	10404	15	156060	16014	0.9411764705882353

162	education	Educational institutes and Finances	This table contains information on the finances of government-funded institutions in primary, secondary and tertiary education. Primary education comprises of primary general education, primary special education (SBO) and primary special-needs education (SO). Secondary education constitutes secondary general education, secondary vocational education (MBO) and adult education. Tertiary education encompasses higher professional education (HBO) and university education (WO).\nAll educational institutions are funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science as of 2018. Educational institutions that provided agricultural education were funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs until 2018. Educational institutions are legally obligated to annually submit their financial statements before the 1st of July to the Education Executive Agency (DUO) of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. The data from the financial statements is subsequently processed by DUO and transmitted to Statistics Netherlands.\nFinancial information regarding primary educational institutions is available from 2006 onwards, as a result of the introduction of lump sum funding in the same year, which legally obligated these institutions to provide their financial information to the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. The finances for the educational institutions in the secondary and tertiary education are available since 1998. Financial information related to special-needs educational institutions is available separately and concerns the educational institutions with school boards solely overseeing special-needs education in both primary and secondary education. Please note that the educational institutions of Caribbean Netherlands are included in the table from 2010 onwards, due to the islands of Caribbean Netherlands becoming part of the Netherlands as of October 2010.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/niramay/educational-institutes-and-finances	{education}	{"Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)"}	{"ï»¿\\"ID\\";\\"EducationSectors\\";\\"Periods\\";\\"OperatingIncome_1\\";\\"GrantsFromTheState_2\\";\\"OtherGovernmentalGrants_3\\";\\"TuitionAndExamFees_4\\";\\"IncomeFromContractsWithThirdParties_5\\";\\"OtherIncome_6\\";\\"OperatingCosts_7\\";\\"PersonnelCosts_8\\";\\"Depreciation_9\\";\\"HousingCosts_10\\";\\"TotalOtherCosts_11\\";\\"AdministrativeCosts_12\\";\\"InventoryMaterialAndTeachingAid_13\\";\\"Other_14\\";\\"OperatingResult1_15\\";\\"NetFinancialCosts2_16\\";\\"SpecialEntries3_17\\";\\"Result123_18\\";\\"TotalAssets_19\\";\\"TotalFixedAssets_20\\";\\"NonFinancialIntangibleFixedAssets_21\\";\\"TotalNonFinancialTangibleFixedAs_22\\";\\"BuildingsAndLand_23\\";\\"InventoryAndEquipment_24\\";\\"OtherNonFinancialTangibleFixedAs_25\\";\\"FinancialFixedAssets_26\\";\\"TotalCurrentAssets_27\\";\\"Inventory_28\\";\\"Receivables_29\\";\\"ShortTermSecurities_30\\";\\"LiquidAssets_31\\";\\"TotalLiabilitiesAndEquity_32\\";\\"Equity_33\\";\\"Provisions_34\\";\\"LongTermDebt_35\\";\\"ShortTermDebt_36\\";\\"TotalInvestmentsGross_37\\";\\"InvestmentsGrossBuildingsAndLand_38\\";\\"InvestmentsGrossInventoryAndEq_39\\";\\"SolvencyRatio_40\\";\\"CurrentRatio_41\\";\\"ProfitMargin_42\\";\\"ResilienceRatio_43\\";\\"CapitalizationFactor_44\\""}	189	1	189	0	0.9705882352941176

177	education	Global Education	**Description:**\n\nA good education offers individuals the opportunity to lead richer, more interesting lives. At a societal level, it creates opportunities for humanity to solve its pressing problems.\n\nThe world has gone through a dramatic transition over the last few centuries, from one where very few had any basic education to one where most people do. This is not only reflected in the inputs to education – enrollment and attendance – but also in outcomes, where literacy rates have greatly improved.\n\nGetting children into school is also not enough. What they learn matters. There are large differences in educational outcomes: in low-income countries, most children cannot read by the end of primary school. These inequalities in education exacerbate poverty and existing inequalities in global incomes.\n\n**About Dataset:**\nThere are 4 dataset in this page:\n1- share-of-the-world-population-with-at-least-basic-education:\n\nAccess to education is now seen as a fundamental right – in many cases, it’s the government’s duty to provide it.\n\nBut formal education is a very recent phenomenon. In the chart, we see the share of the adult population – those older than 15 – that has received some basic education and those who haven’t.\n\nIn the early 1800s, fewer than 1 in 5 adults had some basic education. Education was a luxury, in all places, it was only available to a small elite.\n\nBut you can see that this share has grown dramatically, such that this ratio is now reversed. Less than 1 in 5 adults has not received any formal education.\n\nThis is reflected in literacy data, too: 200 years ago, very few could read and write. Now most adults have basic literacy skills.\n\n\n2- learning-adjusted-years-of-school-lays:\n\nThere are still significant inequalities in the amount of education children get across the world.\n\nThis can be measured as the total number of years that children spend in school. However, researchers can also adjust for the quality of education to estimate how many years of quality learning they receive. This is done using an indicator called “learning-adjusted years of schooling”.\n\nOn the map, you see vast differences across the world.\n\nIn many of the world’s poorest countries, children receive less than three years of learning-adjusted schooling. In most rich countries, this is more than 10 years.\n\nAcross most countries in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa – where the largest share of children live – the average years of quality schooling are less than 7.\n\n\n3- number-of-out-of-school-children:\n\nWhile most children worldwide get the opportunity to go to school, hundreds of millions still don’t.\n\nIn the chart, we see the number of children who aren’t in school across primary and secondary education.\n\nThis number was around 260 million in 2019.\n\nMany children who attend primary school drop out and do not attend secondary school. That means many more children or adolescents are missing from secondary school than primary education.\n\n4- gender-gap-education-levels:\n\nGlobally, until recently, boys were more likely to attend school than girls. The world has focused on closing this gap to ensure every child gets the opportunity to go to school.\n\nToday, these gender gaps have largely disappeared. In the chart, we see the difference in the global enrollment rates for primary, secondary, and tertiary (post-secondary) education. The share of children who complete primary school is also shown.\n\nWe see these lines converging over time, and recently they met: rates between boys and girls are the same.\n\nFor tertiary education, young women are now more likely than young men to be enrolled.\n\n**Have a great analysis !**\n\nBy Hannah Ritchie, Veronika Samborska, Natasha Ahuja, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Max Roser	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/global-education	{"arts and entertainment",global,education}	{other}	{Entity,Code,Year,"Share of population with no formal education, 1820-2020","Share of population with some formal education, 1820-2020","Learning-Adjusted Years of School","Out-of-school children, adolescents and youth of primary and secondary school age, male (number)","Out-of-school children, adolescents and youth of primary and secondary school age, female (number)","Combined gross enrolment ratio for tertiary education, female","Combined gross enrolment ratio for tertiary education, male","Combined total net enrolment rate, secondary, male","Combined total net enrolment rate, secondary, female","Combined total net enrolment rate, primary, female","Combined total net enrolment rate, primary, male"}	12913	23	100840	13406	1

185	education	Human Development Report 2015	# Content\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of achievements in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of education for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of education for children, and the standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) adjusts the HDI for inequality in the distribution of each dimension across the population.\n\nThe Gender Development Index (GDI) measures gender inequalities in achievement in three basic dimensions of human development: health, measured by female and male life expectancy at birth; education, measured by female and male expected years of education for children and female and male mean years of education for adults ages 25 and older; and command over economic resources, measured by female and male estimated earned income. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions—reproductive health, empowerment, and the labour market—for as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions.\n\nThe Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) identifies multiple deprivations at the household level in education, health, and standard of living as indicators of poverty. It uses micro data from household surveys, and — unlike the IHDI — all the indicators needed to construct the measure must come from the same survey.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/undp/human-development	{demographics,"international relations"}	{CC-BY-SA-4.0}	{"GDI Rank",Country,"Gender Development Index (GDI)","Human Development Index (Female)","Human Development Index (Male)","Life Expectancy at Birth (Female)","Life Expectancy at Birth (Male)","Expected Years of Education (Female)","Expected Years of Education (Male)","Mean Years of Education (Female)","Mean Years of Education (Male)","Estimated Gross National Income per Capita (Female)","Estimated Gross National Income per Capita (Male)","GII Rank","Gender Inequality Index (GII)","Maternal Mortality Ratio","Adolescent Birth Rate","Percent Representation in Parliament","Population with Secondary Education (Female)","Population with Secondary Education (Male)","Labour Force Participation Rate (Female)","Labour Force Participation Rate (Male)","HDI Rank","Human Development Index (1990)","Human Development Index (2000)","Human Development Index (2010)","Human Development Index (2011)","Human Development Index (2012)","Human Development Index (2013)","Human Development Index (2014)","Human Development Index (HDI)","Life Expectancy at Birth","Expected Years of Education","Mean Years of Education","Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita","GNI per Capita Rank Minus HDI Rank","IHDI Rank","Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI)","IHDI Loss Percent","IHDI Rank Difference","Coefficient of Human Inequality","Inequality in Life Expectancy","Inequality-Adjusted Life Expectancy Index","Inequality in Education","Inequality-Adjusted Education Index","Inequality in Income","Inequality-Adjusted Income Index","Income Inequality (Quintile Ratio)","Income Inequality (Palma Rati)","Income Inequality (Gini Coefficient)","Year and Survey","Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI, HDRO)","MPI HDRO Percent","Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI, 2010)","MPI 2010 Percent","Population in Multidimensional Poverty","Intensity of Deprivation","Education Deprivation","Health Deprivation","Living Standards","Population Below National Poverty Line","Population Below $1.25 per Day"}	1076	69	12233	74	0.8529411764705882

190	education	Inequality in Education Around the World	### Context\n\nIn today's interconnected world, the issue of inequality in education stands as a stark reminder of the disparities that persist across countries and communities. While strides have been made to improve access to education, a significant proportion of children still lack the opportunity to learn, particularly in low-income and conflict-affected regions. Quality of education also diverges, with well-equipped schools in affluent areas contrasting with under-resourced institutions in marginalized settings. Gender inequality further compounds the problem, as cultural norms and economic factors often impede girls' education in certain societies. Tackling inequality in education isn't just a matter of fairness; it's a critical step towards building equitable societies and empowering individuals to contribute meaningfully to their own development and that of their nations.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains historical data covering a range of indicators pertaining to educational inequality on a global scale. The dataset's prominent components include: ISO3, Country, Human Development Groups, UNDP Developing Regions, HDI Rank (2021), and Inequality in Education spanning the years 2010 to 2021.\n\n### Dataset Glossary (Column-wise)\n\n* <b>ISO3</b> - ISO3 for the Country/Territory\n* <b>Country</b> - Name of the Country/Territory\n* <b>Human Development Groups</b> - Human Development Groups\n* <b>UNDP Developing Regions</b> - UNDP Developing Regions\n* <b>HDI Rank (2021)</b> - Human Development Index Rank for 2021\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2010)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2010\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2011)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2011\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2012)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2012\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2013)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2013\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2014)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2014\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2015)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2015\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2016)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2016\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2017)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2017\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2018)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2018\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2019)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2019\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2020)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2020\n* <b>Inequality in Education (2021)</b> - Inequality in Education for 2021\n\n### Data Dictionary\n\n* <b>UNDP Developing Regions</b>:\n - <b>SSA</b> - Sub-Saharan Africa\n - <b>LAC</b> - Latin America and the Caribbean\n - <b>EAP</b> - East Asia and the Pacific\n - <b>AS</b> - Arab States\n - <b>ECA</b> - Europe and Central Asia\n - <b>SA</b> - South Asia\n\n### Structure of the Dataset\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qX5cmUX.png)\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nThis Dataset is created from <b>[Human Development Reports](https://hdr.undp.org/)</b>.

192	education	Lead Scoring X Online Education	### Lead Scoring Case Study - Problem Statement\n\nAn education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. \n\n The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. \n\n \n\nNow, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone. A typical lead conversion process can be represented using the following funnel:\n\n\nLead Conversion Process - Demonstrated as a funnel\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F3515295%2Fa031932efdd103c26332798adad58047%2FXNote_201901081613670.jpg?generation=1573575207907385&alt=media)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage (top) but only a few of them come out as paying customers from the bottom. In the middle stage, you need to nurture the potential leads well (i.e. educating the leads about the product, constantly communicating etc. ) in order to get a higher lead conversion.\n\n \n\nX Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.\n\n\n### Content\n\nYou have been provided with a leads dataset from the past with around 9000 data points. This dataset consists of various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. which may or may not be useful in ultimately deciding whether a lead will be converted or not. The target variable, in this case, is the column ‘Converted’ which tells whether a past lead was converted or not wherein 1 means it was converted and 0 means it wasn’t converted. You can learn more about the dataset from the data dictionary provided in the zip folder at the end of the page. Another thing that you also need to check out for are the levels present in the categorical variables. Many of the categorical variables have a level called 'Select' which needs to be handled because it is as good as a null value (think why?).\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis data set is created by UpGrad-IIIT-B and given as part of assignment\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThere are quite a few goals for this case study.\n\nBuild a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmikalyan/lead-scoring-x-online-education	{business,education,"logistic regression",pca}	{other}	{"Prospect ID","Lead Number","Lead Origin","Lead Source","Do Not Email","Do Not Call",Converted,TotalVisits,"Total Time Spent on Website","Page Views Per Visit","Last Activity",Country,Specialization,"How did you hear about X Education","What is your current occupation","What matters most to you in choosing a course",Search,Magazine,"Newspaper Article","X Education Forums",Newspaper,"Digital Advertisement","Through Recommendations","Receive More Updates About Our Courses",Tags,"Lead Quality","Update me on Supply Chain Content","Get updates on DM Content","Lead Profile",City,"Asymmetrique Activity Index","Asymmetrique Profile Index","Asymmetrique Activity Score","Asymmetrique Profile Score","I agree to pay the amount through cheque","A free copy of Mastering The Interview","Last Notable Activity"}	9240	37	341880	41039	0.7058823529411765

There are 162 universities out of which 64 are in private sector and 98 are public sector/government universities recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC). \n\n\nAccording to HEC, Pakistani universities are producing over half a million graduates per year, which include over more than 10,000 Computer Science/IT graduates.  \n\n\nFrom year 2001 to 2015 there is a mass increase in number of enrollment in universities. The recent statistics shows that in 2015, 1,298,600 students enrolled in different levels of degree, 869,378 in Bachelors (16 years), 63,412 in Bachelors (17 years), 219,280 in Masters (16 years), 124,107 in M.Phil/MS, 14,373 in Ph.D, and 8,319 in P.G.D. However, in 2014 the number of doctoral degree awarded were 1,351 only. \n\nMoreover, according to HEC report, in 2014-2015 there are over 10,125 fulltime Ph.D. faculty teaching in Pakistan in all disciplines. Computer Science and related disciplines are widely taught in Pakistan with over 90 universities offering this discipline with qualified faculty. According to our dataset, there are 504 PhD faculty members in Computer Science in Pakistan for 10,000 students.  So we have a PhD faculty member for every 20 students on average in computer science program. \n\nCurrent Student to PhD Professor Ratio in Pakistan is 130:1 (while India is [going towards][1] 10:1 in Post-Graduate and 25:1 in Undergrad education).\n\nHere is world's [Top 100 universities][2] with Student to Staff Ratio.\n\n\n\n### Content\n\n**Dataset:** The dataset contains list of computer science/IT professors from 89 different universities of Pakistan.  \n\n**Variables:** The dataset contains Serial No, Teacher’s Name, University Currently Teaching, Department, Province University Located, Designation, Terminal Degree, Graduated from (university for professor), Country of graduation, Year, Area of Specialization/Research Interests, and some Other Information\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nData has been collected from respective university websites.

It includes comprehensive demographic details such as age, gender, marital status and income category, as well as insight into each customer’s relationship with the credit card provider such as the card type, number of months on book and inactive periods. Additionally it holds key data about customers’ spending behavior drawing closer to their churn decision such as total revolving balance, credit limit, average open to buy rate and analyzable metrics like total amount of change from quarter 4 to quarter 1, average utilization ratio and Naive Bayes classifier attrition flag (Card category is combined with contacts count in 12months period alongside dependent count plus education level & months inactive). Faced with this set of useful predicted data points across multiple variables capture up-to-date information that can determine long term account stability or an impending departure therefore offering us an equipped understanding when seeking to manage a portfolio or serve individual customers\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset can be used to analyze the key factors that influence customer attrition. Analysts can use this dataset to understand customer demographics, spending patterns, and relationship with the credit card provider to better predict customer attrition. \n&gt; \n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Using the customer demographics, such as gender, marital status, education level and income category to determine which customer demographic is more likely to churn. \n&gt; - Analyzing the customer’s spending behavior leading up to churning and using this data to better predict the likelihood of a customer of churning in the future. \n&gt; - Creating a classifier that can predict potential customers who are more susceptible to attrition based on their credit score, credit limit, utilization ratio and other spending behavior metrics over time; this could be used as an early warning system for predicting potential attrition before it happens\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/4322342#.Y8OsBdJBwUE)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

It includes demographic data, social-economic factors and academic performance information that can be used to analyze the possible predictors of student dropout and academic success. This dataset contains multiple disjoint databases consisting of relevant information available at the time of enrollment, such as application mode, marital status, course chosen and more. Additionally, this data can be used to estimate overall student performance at the end of each semester by assessing curricular units credited/enrolled/evaluated/approved as well as their respective grades. Finally, we have unemployment rate, inflation rate and GDP from the region which can help us further understand how economic factors play into student dropout rates or academic success outcomes. This powerful analysis tool will provide valuable insight into what motivates students to stay in school or abandon their studies for a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy, design, education nursing journalism management social service or technologies\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset can be used to understand and predict student dropouts and academic outcomes. The data includes a variety of demographic, social-economic and academic performance factors related to the students enrolled in higher education institutions. The dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that affect student success and could be used to guide interventions and policies related to student retention.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using this dataset, researchers can investigate two key questions: \n&gt; - which specific predictive factors are linked with student dropout or completion? \n&gt; - how do different features interact with each other? \n&gt; For example, researchers could explore if there any demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age at enrollment etc.) or immersion conditions (e.g., unemployment rate in region) are associated with higher student success rates, as well as understand what implications poverty has for educational outcomes.  By answering these questions, research insight is generated which can provide critical information for administrators on formulating strategies that promote successful degree completion among students from diverse backgrounds in their institutions.             \n&gt;                     \n&gt; In order to use this dataset effectively it is important that scientists familiarize themselves with all variables provided in the dataset including categorical (qualitative) variables such as gender or application mode; numerical variables such as number of curricular units at the beginning of semesters or age at enrollment; ordinal data measurement type variables such as marital status; studied trends over time such as inflation rate or GDP; frequency measurements variables like percentage of scholarship holders; etc.. Additionally scientists should make sure they aware off all potential bias included in the data prior running analysis–for example understanding if one population is underrepresented compared another -as this phenomenon could lead unexpected results if not taken into consideration while conducting research undertaken using this data set.. Finally it would be important for practitioners realize that this current Kaggle Dataset contains only one semester-worth information on each admission intake whereas additional studies conducted for a longer time period might be able provide more accurate results related selected topic area due further deterioration retention achievement coefficients obtained from those gradually accurate experiments unfolding different year-long admissions seasons\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Prediction of Student Retention: This dataset can be used to develop predictive models that can identify student risk factors for dropout and take early interventions to improve student retention rate. \n&gt; - Improved Academic Performance: By using this data, higher education institutions could better understand their students' academic progress and identify areas of improvement from both an individual and institutional perspective. This will enable them to develop targeted courses, activities, or initiatives that enhance academic performance more effectively and efficiently. \n&gt; - Accessibility Assistance: Using the demographic information included in the dataset, institutions could develop specific initiatives designed to help certain groups more easily access higher education services or resources that may not typically be available in their area or for their social-economic class, helping close existing gaps in accessibility across different student populations\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/5777340#.Y7FJotJBwUE)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n&gt; No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

208	education	Pre-primary education rate	Context\nResearch shows that pre-primary education is critical for setting strong foundations for a child’s social, emotional and overall well-being. The early years of a child’s life build the basis for lifelong growth and children who fall behind in these early years often never catch up with their peers, leaving these children more vulnerable to underachievement and dropping out of school.\n\nAccess to pre-primary education has almost doubled over the past 20 years. Despite this progress, more than 175 million children – or half of the pre-primary aged children globally – do not have access to this important experience. On a global scale, gender disparity is low, but wealth and location have a big influence on access. This means that both, boys and girls have roughly equal access, but children from rural areas, families with low socioeconomic status and less-developed regions experience higher barriers to an appropriate education. In sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, access to pre-primary education for children from the poorest families is less than half as compared to children from the wealthiest families. \n\nContent\nthis dataset content the pre-primary education rate more than 200 countries.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThanks for UNICEF for sharing data.\n\nInspiration\nThis dataset provides complete information about child mortality rate. There are many inferences that can be made from this dataset. There are a few things I would like to understand from this dataset.\n\n1. Various factors affecting the pre-primary education rate.\n2.

218	education	Sindh School Education	# Context\nSindh is a province in Pakistan and is known for its rich cultural heritage and history. The education system in Sindh is overseen by the Sindh Education and Literacy Department, which is responsible for the development and implementation of policies related to education in the province. The department works to provide access to quality education for all students in Sindh, with a focus on increasing enrollment and improving the quality of education. The primary and secondary education system in Sindh is based on the national curriculum set by the government of Pakistan.\n In addition to government schools, there are also many private schools in Sindh that offer education in English and other languages.

This includes ensuring that all schools in the province have access to proper facilities and resources, as well as providing teacher training and support.\nOne of the main challenges facing the Sindh school education system is the high dropout rate among students. Many students, particularly those from low-income families, are forced to leave school early in order to help support their families financially. The government of Sindh has implemented various programs and initiatives aimed at reducing the dropout rate, such as providing scholarships and financial assistance to low-income students.\nDespite these challenges, the Sindh school education system has made significant progress in recent years. The literacy rate in the province has improved, and there has been an increase in the number of students graduating from primary and secondary schools. The government of Sindh has also been investing in education infrastructure and technology to improve the quality of education and make it more accessible to all students.\nIn conclusion, Sindh School education system is constantly evolving, facing various challenges but have made significant progress in recent years.

Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd-period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set	{education,"standardized testing"}	{CC0-1.0}	{school,sex,age,address,famsize,Pstatus,Medu,Fedu,Mjob,Fjob,reason,guardian,traveltime,studytime,failures,schoolsup,famsup,paid,activities,nursery,higher,internet,romantic,famrel,freetime,goout,Dalc,Walc,health,absences,G1,G2,G3}	649	33	21417	0	1

227	education	US Adult Income	US Adult Census data relating income to social factors such as Age, Education, race etc.\n\nThe Us Adult income dataset was extracted  by Barry Becker from the 1994 US Census Database. The data set consists of anonymous information such as occupation, age, native country, race, capital gain, capital loss, education, work class and more.\nEach row is labelled as either having a salary greater than ">50K" or "<=50K".\n\nThis Data set is split into two CSV files, named `adult-training.txt` and `adult-test.txt`.\n\nThe goal here is to train a binary classifier on the training dataset to predict the column `income_bracket` which has two possible values ">50K" and "<=50K"  and evaluate the accuracy of the classifier with the test dataset. \n\nNote that the dataset is made up of categorical and continuous features. It also contains missing values \nThe categorical columns are: workclass, education, marital_status, occupation, relationship, race, gender, native_country\n\nThe continuous columns are: age, education_num, capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week\n\n\nThis Dataset was obtained from the UCI repository, it can be found  on\n\nhttps://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income, \nhttp://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/\n\n\n\nUSAGE\nThis dataset is well suited to developing and testing wide linear classifiers, deep neutral network classifiers and a combination of both.

228	education	2022 US College Rankings and Tuition Costs	I wanted to look at the relationship between US college tuition and the quality of schools in 2022.  While quality is very subjective, and the U.S. News & World Report rankings have received a lot of criticism of late for its methodology, it's still the most common means of evaluation. It is my hope that this dataset can be used to better evaluate the relationship between tuition and school rankings. 	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/dylankarmin/2022-college-rankings-compared-to-tuition-costs	{"universities and colleges"}	{other}	{"College Name","Adjusted Rank",Tuition,"Enrollment Numbers"}	161	4	644	0	1

234	housing	Affordable Housing by Town 2011-2022	The Affordable Housing Appeals Procedure List is published annually on or about February 1. The data for the Affordable Housing Appeals Procedure List comes from different sources including federal, state and local programs. This makes it difficult to ensure complete accuracy, so DOH asks municipalities to provide a local administrative review of and input on the street addresses of units and projects as well as information on deed-restricted units. The responses received by DOH vary widely from each municipality.\n\nIn developing the Affordable Housing Appeals Procedure List, DOH counts:\n\n-Assisted housing units or housing receiving financial assistance under any governmental program for the construction or substantial rehabilitation of low and moderate income housing that was occupied or under construction by the end date of the report period for compilation of a given year’s list; -Rental housing occupied by persons receiving rental assistance under C.G.S. Chapter 138a (State Rental Assistance/RAP) or Section 142f of Title 42 of the U.S. Code (Section 8); -Ownership housing or housing currently financed by the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority and/or the U.S. Department of Agriculture; and -Deed-restricted properties or properties with deeds containing covenants or restrictions that require such dwelling unit(s) be sold or rented at or below prices that will preserve the unit(s) as affordable housing as defined in C.G.S. Section 8-39a for persons or families whose incomes are less than or equal to 80% of the area median income.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/affordable-housing-by-town-2011-2022	{housing,finance,"real estate",investing,"social issues and advocacy"}	{"U.S. Government Works"}	{Year,"Town Code",Town,"2010 Census Units","Government Assisted","Tenant Rental Assistance"," Single Family CHFA/ USDA Mortgages","Deed Restricted Units","Total Assisted Units","Percent Affordable"}	2025	10	20250	1	1
235	housing	Ames Housing Dataset Engineered	### Iowa Housing Data\n\nThe original Ames data that is being used for the competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques and predicting sales price](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) is edited and engineered to suit a beginner for applying a model without worrying too much about missing data while focusing on the features. \n\n\n### Contents\n\nThe train data has the shape 1460x80 and test data has the shape 1458x79 with feature 'SalePrice' to be predicted for the test set. \nThe train data has different types of features, categorical and numerical. \n\nA detailed info about the data can be obtained from the Data Description file among other data files.\n\n### Transformations\n\na. Handling Missing Values:\n Some variables such as 'PoolQC', 'MiscFeature', 'Alley' have over 90% missing values. However from the data description, it is implied that the missing value indicates the absence of such features in a particular house. Well, most of the missing data implies the feature does not exist for the particular house on further inspection of the dataset and data description. \n\nSimilarly, features which are missing such as 'GarageType', 'GarageYrBuilt', 'BsmtExposure', etc indicated no garage in that house but also corresponding attributes such as 'GarageCars', 'GarageArea','BsmtCond' etc are set to 0. \n\nA house on a street might have similar front lawn area to the houses in the same neighborhood, hence the missing values can be median of the values in a neighborhood.\n\nMissing values in features such as 'SaleType', 'KitchenCond', etc have been imputed with the mode of the feature. \n\nb. Dropping Variables:\n'Utilities' attribute should be dropped from the data frame because almost all the houses have all public Utilities (E,G,W,& S) available.\n\nc. Further exploration:\nThe feature 'Electrical' has one missing value. The first intuition would be to drop the row. But on further inspection, the missing value is from a house built in 2006. After the 1970's all the houses have Standard Circuit Breakers & Romex 'SkBrkr' installed. So, the value can be inferred from this observation. \n\nd. Transformation: \nThere were some variables which are really categorical but were represented numerically such as 'MSSubClass', 'OverallCond' and 'YearSold'/'MonthSold' as they are discrete in nature. These have also been transformed to categorical variables. \n\ne. X Normalizing the 'SalePrice' Variable:\nDuring EDA it was discovered that the Sale price of homes is right skewed. However on normalizing the skewness decreases and the (linear) models fit better. The feature is left for the user to normalize. \n\nFinally the train and test sets were split and sale price appended to train set. \n\n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. \n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe data after the transformation done by me can easily be fitted on to a model after label encoding and normalizing features to reduce skewness. \nThe main variable to be predicted is 'SalePrice' for the TestData csv file.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/anishpai/ames-housing-dataset-missing	{housing,"real estate","exploratory data analysis",tabular,regression}	{copyright-authors}	{Id,MSSubClass,MSZoning,LotFrontage,LotArea,Street,Alley,LotShape,LandContour,LotConfig,LandSlope,Neighborhood,Condition1,Condition2,BldgType,HouseStyle,OverallQual,OverallCond,YearBuilt,YearRemodAdd,RoofStyle,RoofMatl,Exterior1st,Exterior2nd,MasVnrType,MasVnrArea,ExterQual,ExterCond,Foundation,BsmtQual,BsmtCond,BsmtExposure,BsmtFinType1,BsmtFinSF1,BsmtFinType2,BsmtFinSF2,BsmtUnfSF,TotalBsmtSF,Heating,HeatingQC,CentralAir,Electrical,1stFlrSF,2ndFlrSF,LowQualFinSF,GrLivArea,BsmtFullBath,BsmtHalfBath,FullBath,HalfBath,BedroomAbvGr,KitchenAbvGr,KitchenQual,TotRmsAbvGrd,Functional,Fireplaces,FireplaceQu,GarageType,GarageYrBlt,GarageFinish,GarageCars,GarageArea,GarageQual,GarageCond,PavedDrive,WoodDeckSF,OpenPorchSF,EnclosedPorch,3SsnPorch,ScreenPorch,PoolArea,PoolQC,Fence,MiscFeature,MiscVal,MoSold,YrSold,SaleType,SaleCondition,SalePrice}	2919	159	232061	15016	0.9117647058823529

238	housing	Amsterdam House Price Prediction	### Context\nIf you are like me, you might get overwhelmed when having to make big decisions such as buying a house. In such cases, I always like to go for a data driven approach, that will help me find an optimum solution. This involves two steps. First, we need to gather as much data as we can. Second, we need to define a metric for success. \n\nGathering housing prices requires some effort. A caveat is that the asking prices are not the prices to which the houses were actually sold. Defining a metric for success is somewhat subjective. I consider a house to be a good option if the house price is cheap compared to other listings in the area. \n\n### Content\nThe housing prices have been obtained from Pararius.nl as a snapshot in August 2021. The original data provided features such as price, floor area and the number of rooms. The data has been further enhanced by utilising the Mapbox API to obtain the coordinates of each listing. \n\n### Acknowledgements\nThanks to Pararius	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/thomasnibb/amsterdam-house-price-prediction	{housing,"real estate",beginner,xgboost,"linear regression",investing}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Unnamed: 0",Address,Zip,Price,Area,Room,Lon,Lat}	924	8	7392	4	1

241	housing	Banking Dataset - Marketing Targets	### Context\n\nTerm deposits are a major source of income for a bank.  A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term. The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing.\n\nTelephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call. \n\nThe data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe data is related to the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.

Past Usage:\n\n  The full dataset (bank-additional-full.csv) was described and analyzed in:\n\n  S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems (2014), doi:10.1016/j.dss.2014.03.001.\n\n4. Relevant Information:\n\n   This dataset is based on "Bank Marketing" UCI dataset (please check the description at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).\n   The data is enriched by the addition of five new social and economic features/attributes (national wide indicators from a ~10M population country), published by the Banco de Portugal and publicly available at: https://www.bportugal.pt/estatisticasweb.\n   This dataset is almost identical to the one used in [Moro et al., 2014] (it does not include all attributes due to privacy concerns).\n   Using the rminer package and R tool (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rminer/), we found that the addition of the five new social and economic attributes (made available here) lead to substantial improvement in the prediction of a success, even when the duration of the call is not included. Note: the file can be read in R using: d=read.table("bank-additional-full.csv",header=TRUE,sep=";")\n\nThe binary classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit (variable y).\n\n5.

248	housing	California House Price 	**DESCRIPTION**\n\nThe US Census Bureau has published California Census Data which has 10 types of metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. The dataset also serves as an input for project scoping and tries to specify the functional and nonfunctional r requirements for it.\n\n**Problem Objective:**\nThe project aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median house values in California using the provided dataset. This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.\n\nDistricts or block groups are the smallest geographical units for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). There are 20,640 districts in the project dataset.\n\n**Domain:** Finance and Housing\n\n**Analysis Tasks:**\n1. Build a model of housing prices to predict median house values in California using the provided dataset.\n2. Train the model to learn from the data to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.\n3. Predict housing prices based on median_income and plot the regression chart for it.\n\nLoad the data :\n•\tRead the “housing.csv” file from the folder into the program.\n•\tPrint first few rows of this data.\n•\tExtract input (X) and output (Y) data from the dataset.\n\nHandle missing values :\n•\tFill the missing values with the mean of the respective column.\n\nEncode categorical data :\n•\tConvert categorical column in the dataset to numerical data.\n\nSplit the dataset : \n•\tSplit the data into 80% training dataset and 20% test dataset.\n\nStandardize data :\n•\tStandardize training and test datasets.\n\nPerform Linear Regression : \n•\tPerform Linear Regression on training data.\n•\tPredict output for test dataset using the fitted model.\n•\tPrint root mean squared error (RMSE) from Linear Regression.\n            [ HINT: Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics ]\n\nBonus exercise: Perform Linear Regression with one independent variable :\n•\tExtract just the median_income column from the independent variables (from X_train and X_test).\n•\tPerform Linear Regression to predict housing values based on median_income.\n•\tPredict output for test dataset using the fitted model.\n•\tPlot the fitted model for training data as well as for test data to check if the fitted model satisfies the test data.\n\nDataset Size: 20640 rows x 10 columns	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/shibumohapatra/house-price	{"social science","exploratory data analysis",numpy,pandas}	{"GNU Lesser General Public License 3.0"}	{longitude,latitude,housing_median_age,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income,ocean_proximity,median_house_value}	20640	10	206400	207	1

250	housing	California Housing Prices Data (5 new features!)	### Similar Datasets:\n\n- Boston House Prices: [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/the-boston-houseprice-data)\n- Gender Pay Gap Dataset: [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/gender-pay-gap-dataset)\n- Company Bankruptcy Prediction: [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction)\n- Spanish Wine Quality Dataset: [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/spanish-wine-quality-dataset)\n\n\n### Context\n\nThis is the dataset is a modified version of the California Housing Data used in the paper `Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. "Sparse spatial autoregressions." Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.`. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being too toyish and too cumbersome.\n\nThe data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.\n\n\n### Modifications with respect to the original data\n\nThis dataset includes 5 extra features defined by me: "Distance to coast", "Distance to Los Angeles", "Distance to San Diego", "Distance to San Jose", and "Distance to San Francisco". These extra features try to account for the distance to the nearest coast and the distance to the centre of the largest cities in California.\n\nThe distances were calculated using the Haversine formula with the Longitude and Latitude:\n\n![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a65dbbde43ff45bacd2505fcf32b44fc7dcd8cc0)\n\nwhere:\n\n- `phi_1` and `phi_2` are the Latitudes of point 1 and point 2, respectively\n- `lambda_1` and `lambda_2` are the Longitudes of point 1 and point 2, respectively\n- `r` is the radius of the Earth (6371km)\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self-explanatory:\n\n1) Median House Value: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars) [$]\n2) Median Income: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars) [10k$]\n3) Median Age: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building [years]\n4) Total Rooms: Total number of rooms within a block\n5) Total Bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block\n6) Population: Total number of people residing within a block\n7) Households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block\n8) Latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north [°]\n9) Longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west [°]\n10) Distance to coast: Distance to the nearest coast point [m]\n11) Distance to Los Angeles: Distance to the centre of Los Angeles [m]\n12) Distance to San Diego: Distance to the centre of San Diego [m]\n13) Distance to San Jose: Distance to the centre of San Jose [m]\n14) Distance to San Francisco: Distance to the centre of San Francisco [m]\n\n\n### Source\n\nThis data was entirely modified and cleaned by me. The original data (without the distance features) was initially featured in the following paper:\nPace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. "Sparse spatial autoregressions."

The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\n\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.\n```	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/mental-health-care	{healthcare,"public health",health,"health conditions","jobs and career"}	{"U.S. Government Works"}	{Indicator,Group,State,Subgroup,Phase,"Time Period","Time Period Label","Time Period Start Date","Time Period End Date",Value,LowCI,HighCI,"Confidence Interval","Quartile Range","Suppression Flag"}	10404	15	156060	16014	0.9411764705882353

259	housing	Family Households with Married Couples Data	### Content  \n\nHousehold is an occupied housing unit.\n Householder is a person in whose name the housing unit is rented or owned. This person must be at least 15 years old.\n Family household is a household in which there is at least 1 person present who is related to the householder by birth, marriage or adoption. \n Family is used to refer to a family household. In general, family consists of those related to each other by birth, marriage or adoption.\n\n This data uses the householder's person weight to describe characteristics of people living in households. As a result, estimates of the number of households do not match estimates of households from the Housing Vacancy Survey (HVS). The HVS is weighted to housing units, rather than the population, in order to more accurately estimate the number of occupied and vacant housing units.

This allows discussing what to do with categorical data.\nNote that the block groups are called "districts" in the Jupyter notebooks, simply because in some contexts the name "block group" was confusing.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/walacedatasci/hands-on-machine-learning-housing-dataset	{housing,education,"social science",beginner}	{unknown}	{longitude,latitude,housing_median_age,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income,median_house_value,ocean_proximity}	20640	10	206400	207	0.7058823529411765

Recently a 'demonstration' notebook has been published ["First place is meaningless in this way!"](https://www.kaggle.com/diegojohnson/first-place-is-meaningless-in-this-way) that extracts the 'solution' from the [full dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset). Now that the 'solution' is readily available the possibility has opened for people to reproduce the competition at home without any daily submission limit. This will open up the possibility of experimenting with advanced techniques such as pipelines with/or various estimators/models in the same notebook, extensive hyper-parameter tuning etc. And all without the risk of 'upsetting' the public leaderboard. Simply download this `solution.csv` file and import it into your script or notebook and evaluate the [Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the data in this file. \n \n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset is the `submission.csv` file that will produce a public leaderboard score of `0.00000`.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n* [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset/metadata) (on kaggle) by @prevek18 \n* [First place is meaningless in this way!](https://www.kaggle.com/diegojohnson/first-place-is-meaningless-in-this-way) by @diegojohnson 	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/carlmcbrideellis/house-prices-advanced-regression-solution-file	{"computer science",regression}	{CC0-1.0}	{Id,SalePrice}	1459	2	2918	0	1
270	housing	House Rent Prediction Dataset	### Context\n\nThe spectrum of housing options in India is incredibly diverse, spanning from the opulent palaces once inhabited by maharajas of yore, to the contemporary high-rise apartment complexes in bustling metropolitan areas, and even to the humble abodes in remote villages, consisting of modest huts. This wide-ranging tapestry of residential choices reflects the significant expansion witnessed in India's housing sector, which has paralleled the upward trajectory of income levels in the country. According to the findings of the Human Rights Measurement Initiative, India currently achieves 60.9% of what is theoretically attainable, considering its current income levels, in ensuring the fundamental right to housing for its citizens. In the realm of housing arrangements, renting, known interchangeably as hiring or letting, constitutes an agreement wherein compensation is provided for the temporary utilization of a resource, service, or property owned by another party. Within this arrangement, a gross lease is one where the tenant is obligated to pay a fixed rental amount, and the landlord assumes responsibility for covering all ongoing property-related expenses. The concept of renting also aligns with the principles of the sharing economy, as it fosters the utilization of assets and resources among individuals or entities, promoting efficiency and access to housing solutions for a broad spectrum of individuals.\n\n### Content\n\nWithin this dataset, you will find a comprehensive collection of data pertaining to nearly 4700+ available residential properties, encompassing houses, apartments, and flats offered for rent.

280	housing	 Housing Market & Prices	## 🏡💰🏠Housing Market Data Attributes 🏠💰🏡\n\nIn the analysis of the housing market, it's essential to understand the various attributes that characterize each housing unit. These attributes provide valuable information for potential buyers, renters, and investors, helping them make informed decisions about their housing choices. Below, we describe the key data attributes used in our housing market analysis:\n\n- **Bedroom Count:** This attribute represents the number of bedrooms in the housing unit, providing insights into its size and capacity.\n\n- **Net Square Meters (Net Sqm):** Net square meters refer to the total usable interior space within the housing unit, excluding common areas like corridors and stairwells. It quantifies the size of the property.\n\n- **Center Distance:** This attribute measures the distance of the housing unit from the central or downtown area of a city or town. It is a valuable metric for potential buyers or renters to assess proximity to urban amenities and activities.\n\n- **Metro Distance:** Metro distance indicates the distance between the housing unit and the nearest metro or subway station. This information is particularly useful for individuals who rely on public transportation for their daily commute.\n\n- **Floor:** The floor attribute specifies the level or story of the housing unit within the building, offering insights into its placement and accessibility within the structure.\n\n- **Age:** The age of the property represents the number of years since its construction or renovation. It plays a crucial role in assessing the condition of the property and potential maintenance requirements.\n\n- **Price:** Price is the cost associated with purchasing or renting the housing unit. It is a fundamental factor for individuals making housing decisions and can be influenced by various attributes such as bedroom count, size, location, and age.\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/rukenmissonnier/final-house	{business}	{other}	{bedroom_count,net_sqm,center_distance,metro_distance,floor,age,price}	4308	7	30156	0	1

326	housing	U.S. Housing Market Factors	The data in this dataset is collected from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).\n\nI decided to create this dataset while reading the research paper [`Factors Affecting House Prices in Cyprus: 1988-2008`](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228632026_Factors_Affecting_House_Prices_in_Cyprus_1988-2008) by Panos Pashardes & Christos S. Savva. This research paper is extremely informative and covers a lot of details regarding the macroeconomics involved in real estate market. So I would recommend you all to go through it once. \n\n#### NOTE:\nThis dataset will be updated over a period of time and include the following:\n- **Macroeconomic factors** with quarterly, monthly frequencies.\n- **Microeconomic factors** such as house type, age, location, size (BR, BA, carpet area/built-up area), facilities, view, disability functions, region, house prices, etc.\n\n#### NOTE 2:\nI recommend you all to check the file in this dataset with the title `Housing_Macroeconomic_Factors_US (2).csv`, it includes both the supply and demand factors associated with the housing market.\n\n### General Defintions:\n##### 1. Macroeconomic Factors\n- `House_Price_Index`: House price change according to the index base period set (you can check the date at which this value is 100).\n- `Stock_Price_Index`: Stock price change according to the index base period set (you can check the date at which this value is 100).\n- `Consumer_Price_Index`: The Consumer Price Index measures the overall change in consumer prices based on a representative basket of goods and services over time.\n- `Population`: Population of USA (unit: thousands).\n- `Unemployment_Rate`: Unemployment rate of USA (unit: percentage).\n- `Real_GDP`: GDP with adjusted inflation (Annual version unit: billions of chain 2012 dollars in, Monthly version unit: Annualised change). \n- `Mortgage_Rate`: Interest charged on mortgages (unit: percentage).\n- `Real_Disposable_Income` (Real Disposable Personal Income): Money left from salary after all the taxes are paid (unit: billions of chain 2012 dollars).\n- `Inflation`: Decline in purchasing power over time (unit: percentage). [Forgot to remove this column in Annual version since CPI is one of the measures used to determine inflation].\n\n--------\n\n### What can you do with this dataset?\n- Perform statistical analysis, find significant features & find the value by which these features affect the house price index (recommend to use a percentage change instead of index).\n- Perform multivariate regression and predict the price of houses using microeconomic features (soon).\n\nThanks!\nIf you like this dataset, I'll appreciate it if you give this dataset a vote! Discussions, suggestions & doubts are always welcome.\nHappy Learning!!\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/faryarmemon/usa-housing-market-factors	{"united states",housing,"real estate",economics,beginner}	{CC0-1.0}	{Date,House_Price_Index,Stock_Price_Index,Consumer_Price_Index,Population,Unemployment_Rate,Real_GDP,Mortgage_Rate,Real_Disposable_Income,house_price_index,population,house_supply,gdp,mortgage_rate,employment_rate,permit_new,ppi_res,m3,cci,delinquency_rate,hcai}	895	31	9755	212	1
327	housing	Utrecht housing dataset	The Utrecht housing dataset is a freely available dataset that can be used by students to learn about data science and machine learning. It is a synthetic dataset that was derived from actual data about the Dutch housing market. Since it is synthetic, it contains no noise and has high quality data. It is suitable for multiple techniques, including decision trees, linear regression, logistic regression and neural networks.\n\nIn July 2022, Stefan Leijnen and Sieuwert van Otterloo taught a one week summerschool ‘AI and machine learning’ at the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences. The goal of this summer school is to make AI and Machine Learning accessible to as many people as possible. Using AI without properly understanding it comes with risks. We want to reduce these risks by giving students from all backgrounds the tools and knowledge to understand AI. Luckily, AI has become more accessible thanks to the existence of many free and open tools and libraries. Any student can train and test algorithms with only a few days of training.\n\nThe Utrecht Housing Dataset was designed for use during day 1, day 2 and day 3. The dataset has multiple different input variables that are interesting to explore. The size is such that it is well suited for visualisations. The dataset represents one of the core tenets of responsible AI: AI should be made accessible to a wide group of people, so that anyone with some university experience can test and evaluate algorithms.\n\nWhen developing the summerschool, we could not find a dataset that was both interesting to analyse and easy to use. Existing datasets often have data quality issues that distract from the learning goals, or are only suited for illustrating one phenomenon.  Many classical machine learning datasets also do not have meaningful tasks.  The problems that one can do with these datasets are either too basic or theoretical. The Utrecht Housing Dataset thus offers a new combination that we found useful in our classroom.\n\nThe dataset is released as creative commons, and can be used freely for any purpose. If you use it, please refer to it as the “The Utrecht housing dataset – example dataset for prediction” by Sieuwert van Otterloo, www.ictinstitute.nl or refer to Sieuwert van Otterloo as the author/source.\n\nThe dataset is provided as a CSV file. Each line contains data for one house. The values are seperated by commas. An example line is the following:\n\n9005, 3520, 44.2, 18.1 ,800, 160, 750, 0, 2138, 5110, 1978, 2, 226000, 286000, 0, 0\n\nThe order of elements is id,zipcode,lot-len,lot-width,lot-area,house-area,garden-size,balcony,x-coor,y-coor,buildyear,bathrooms,taxvalue,retailvalue,energy-eff,monument.\n\n**Input columns\n**\nThe meaning of each column is as follows:\n\nid: a number between 0 and 100000 that is a unique identifier for each house. Do not use this in your algorithms\n\nzipcode: Each house has a zipcode corresponding to the area the house is in. The zipcode can be an indicator of build year or other properties. There are four different zip codes in use: 3520, 3525, 3525, 3800.\n\nlot-len: the length in meters of the plot of land the house is built on. Each house is built on a square plot of land. It can be anything from 5.0 to 100.0 meters\n\nlot-width: the width in meters of the plot of land the house is built on. It can be anything from 5.0 to 100.0 meters\n\nlot-area: the total area of the plot of land the house is built on. You can probably compute this from lot-len and lot-width.\nhouse-area. The living area of the house in square meters. 30.0 square meters is a tiny house, 200.0 square meters would be a mansion.\n\ngarden-size: The size of the garden in square meters. Many people want to have a large garden.\nbalcony: the number of balconies the house has. Common values are 0,1, or 3 balconies\n\nx-coor: the x-coordinate describing the location of the house. It is an integer value between 2000 and 3000\n\ny-coor: the y-coordinate describing the location of the house. It is an integer value between 5000 and 6000\n\nbuildyear. The year that the house was built. Some of the oldest houses are from 1100,, but most houses were built in the 2oth and 21st century.\n\nbathrooms: Most houses in Utrecht have one bathroom. Some houses have 2 or 3 bathrooms\n\n**Output/target values:\n**\ntaxvalue: The taxvalue of the house is a number between 50.000 and 1.000.000 that is a conservative value of the house. It is estimated (often based on real housing data) by the government to determine taxes. In a calm market, it is close to but often slightly lower than the retail value. It is rounded to the nearest 100 euros.\n\nretailvalue: the market value of a house. It is a number between 50.000 and 1.000.000. It is rounded to the nearest 1000 euros.\n\nenergy-eff: This value is either 0 or 1. If it is 1 it means that the house is energy efficient. This is important for certain climate goals of the city of Utrecht\n\nmonument: Some houses in Utrecht, especially older houses, have monumental value since they have a unique architectural design. People have been trying to predict if this is the case from other data, since it is timeconsuming to visit each house and inspect the architecture.\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/ictinstitute/utrecht-housing-dataset	{housing,"real estate","linear regression"}	{CC-BY-SA-4.0}	{ï»¿id,zipcode,lot-len,lot-width,lot-area,house-area,garden-size,balcony,x-coor,y-coor,buildyear,bathrooms,taxvalue,retailvalue,energy-eff,monument,select}	2500	49	40100	0	1

329	health	Argentina provincial data	### Context\n\nWith almost 40 million inhabitants and a diverse geography that encompasses the Andes mountains, glacial lakes, and the Pampas grasslands, Argentina is the second largest country (by area) and has one of the largest economies in South America. It is politically organized as a federation of 23 provinces and an autonomous city, Buenos Aires.\n\n\n### Content\n\nWe will analyze ten economic and social indicators collected for each province. Because these indicators are highly correlated, we will use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce redundancies and highlight patterns that are not apparent in the raw data. After visualizing the patterns, we will use k-means clustering to partition the provinces into groups with similar development levels.\n\nThese results can be used to plan public policy by helping allocate resources to develop infrastructure, education, and welfare programs.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nDataCamp\n\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/kingabzpro/argentina-provincial-data	{healthcare,government}	{GPL-2.0}	{province,gdp,illiteracy,poverty,deficient_infra,school_dropout,no_healthcare,birth_mortal,pop,movie_theatres_per_cap,doctors_per_cap}	22	11	242	0	1

Advocacy against attacks on health care, and providing evidence on the effectiveness of practices to minimize attacks and mitigate the consequences of attacks are the two initiatives of the surveillance system.\n\n<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MZcpVscF/68579908-10156532935817263-108539389847535616-o.jpg" style="border-radius: 10px">\n\nThe SSA is supposed to systematically collect data on attacks on health care, and produce and release the report online immediately after the event. This surveillance system would facilitate accountability through global health governance, improve the visibility of the SSA within WHO and throughout the UN, analyse data to support engagement with perpetrators, and strengthen the SSA as an effective mechanism to safeguard health and human rights. However, the incompetence of WHO in fulfilling its mandate on the issue potentially undermines efforts to engage with those who attack health-care facilities, and weakens efforts to prevent future attacks.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahsangha/attacks-against-health-workers-around-the-world	{healthcare,tabular,"public safety","social issues and advocacy","human rights","hospitals and treatment centers"}	{"ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL)"}	{"Attack ID",Country,"Attack Date","Attack Time","Certainty Level","Attack Type","Total Injured","Total Death","HC Facilities","HC Transport","HC Personnel","HC Supplies Assets","HC Warehouse Storage","HC Patients","HC Other","Type of Facility","Facility Other","HW Abduction","HW Arrest","HW Detention","Patient Abduction","Patient Arrest","Patient Detention"}	3689	23	84847	8584	1
332	health	Automotive Vehicles Engine Health Dataset	The dataset could include various features and measurements related to the engine health of vehicles, such as engine RPM, temperature, pressure, and other sensor data. It may also include metadata on the vehicle, such as make, model, year, and mileage.\n\nOne potential project using this dataset could be to build a predictive maintenance model for automotive engines. By analyzing the patterns and trends in the data, machine learning algorithms could be trained to predict when an engine is likely to require maintenance or repair. This could help vehicle owners and mechanics proactively address potential issues before they become more severe, leading to better vehicle performance and longer engine lifetimes.\n\nAnother potential use for this dataset could be to analyze the performance of different types of engines and vehicles. Researchers could use the data to compare the performance of engines from different manufacturers, for example, or to evaluate the effectiveness of different maintenance strategies. This could help drive innovation and improvements in the automotive industry.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/parvmodi/automotive-vehicles-engine-health-dataset	{"automobiles and vehicles","ml ethics"}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Engine rpm","Lub oil pressure","Fuel pressure","Coolant pressure","lub oil temp","Coolant temp","Engine Condition"}	19535	7	136745	0	0.8823529411764706

336	health	Cause of Deaths around the World (Historical Data)	### Context\n\nA straightforward way to assess the health status of a population is to focus on mortality – or concepts like child mortality or life expectancy, which are based on mortality estimates. A focus on mortality, however, does not take into account that the burden of diseases is not only that they kill people, but that they cause suffering to people who live with them. Assessing health outcomes by both mortality and morbidity (the prevalent diseases) provides a more encompassing view on health outcomes. This is the topic of this entry. The sum of mortality and morbidity is referred to as the ‘burden of disease’ and can be measured by a metric called ‘Disability Adjusted Life Years‘ (DALYs). DALYs are measuring lost health and are a standardized metric that allow for direct comparisons of disease burdens of different diseases across countries, between different populations, and over time. Conceptually, one DALY is the equivalent of losing one year in good health because of either premature death or disease or disability. One DALY represents one lost year of healthy life. The first ‘Global Burden of Disease’ (GBD) was GBD 1990 and the DALY metric was prominently featured in the World Bank’s 1993 World Development Report. Today it is published by both the researchers at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and the ‘Disease Burden Unit’ at the World Health Organization (WHO), which was created in 1998. The IHME continues the work that was started in the early 1990s and publishes the Global Burden of Disease study.\n\n### Content\n\nIn this Dataset, we have Historical Data of different cause of deaths for all ages around the World. The key features of this Dataset are: Meningitis, Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, Parkinson's Disease, Nutritional Deficiencies, Malaria, Drowning, Interpersonal Violence, Maternal Disorders, HIV/AIDS, Drug Use Disorders, Tuberculosis, Cardiovascular Diseases, Lower Respiratory Infections, Neonatal Disorders, Alcohol Use Disorders, Self-harm, Exposure to Forces of Nature, Diarrheal Diseases, Environmental Heat and Cold Exposure, Neoplasms, Conflict and Terrorism, Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic Kidney Disease, Poisonings, Protein-Energy Malnutrition, Road Injuries, Chronic Respiratory Diseases, Cirrhosis and Other Chronic Liver Diseases, Digestive Diseases, Fire, Heat, and Hot Substances, Acute Hepatitis.\n\n### Dataset Glossary (Column-wise)\n\n* <b>01.

341	health	COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset	&gt; ### “Health requires healthy food."###\nRoger Williams (1603 – 1683)\n\n<br>\nIn the past couple months, we’ve witnessed doctors, nurses, paramedics and thousands of medical workers putting their lives on the frontline to save patients who are infected. And as the battle with COVID-19 continues, we should all ask ourselves – What should we do to help out? What can we do to protect our loved ones, those who sacrifice for us, and ourselves from this pandemic?<br>\nThese questions all relate back to the CORD-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge Task Question: [“What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?” ](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=587)\n<br>\nAnd my simple answer is : **We need to protect our families and our own healths by adapting to a healthy diet.**\n<br>\n\n### Inspiration and Research Objectives\n\nThe USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion recommends a very simple daily diet intake guideline: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruits, and 20% protein, but are we really eating in the healthy eating style recommended by these food divisions and balances?\n<br>\nIn this dataset, I have combined data of different types of food, world population obesity and undernourished rate, and global COVID-19 cases count from around the world in order to learn more about how a healthy eating style could help combat the Corona Virus. And from the dataset, we can gather information regarding diet patterns from countries with lower COVID infection rate, and adjust our own diet accordingly. \n<br>\nIn each of the 4 datasets below, I have calculated fat quantity, energy intake (kcal),  food supply quantity (kg), and protein for different categories of food (all calculated as percentage of total intake amount). I've also added on the obesity and undernourished rate (also in percentage) for comparison.

346	health	Demographic Traits Annotations	### Context\n\nThe free-form portions of clinical notes are a significant source of information for research. One path for protecting patient’s privacy is to fully de-identify this information prior to sharing for research purposes . De-identification efforts have focused on known named entities and other known identifier types (names, ages, dates, addresses, ID’s, etc.). However, a note may contain residual “Demographic Traits” (DTs), unique enough to identify the patient when combined with other such facts. While we believe that re-identification is not possible with these demographic traits alone, we hope that giving healthcare organizations the option to remove them will strengthen privacy standards of automatic de-identification systems and bolster their confidence in such systems.\n\nMore specifically, this dataset was used to test the performance of our paper ‘Interactive Deep Learning to Detect Demographic Traits in Free-Form Clinical Notes’. We evaluated our pipeline using a subset of the I2b2 2006 and MIMIC-III datasets.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data contains sentence tagging for MIMIC-III and I2b2 2006 datasets that was used in the paper ‘Interactive Deep Learning to Detect Demographic Traits in Free-Form Clinical Notes’. Every sentence is tagged with its own demographic trait tag (as defined in the "Annotations Guide" file). More formally, the data contains CSV tables each containing rows corresponding to annotated sentences such that every row contains the following example properties: row ID, offset within the note’s text, length and label.\n\nThe label mapping (from character to tag) appears in the "Tagged Categories" file. Furthermore, every note in the MIMIC-III dataset contains a unique row-id (appears in a field within the note). In I2b2 2006, every note also contains a unique number, referred to as record-id (which also appears within the note). These features can be found in our attached CSV's under the row_id and record_id columns appropriately. In both cases the offset is defined from the beginning of the note's text.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/google-health/demographic-traits-annotations	{"social science",demographics,"computer science","deep learning"}	{"Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)"}	{record_id,human_label,begin_in_note,length_in_note,row_id}	1815	12	7260	1	0.5882352941176471

348	health	Drinking_Water_Potability	Context\nAccess to safe drinking water is essential to health, a basic human right, and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional, and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.\n\nContent\nThe drinking_water_potability.csv file contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies.\n\n1. pH value:\nPH is an important parameter in evaluating the acid-base balance of water. It is also the indicator of the acidic or alkaline condition of water status. WHO has recommended the maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The current investigation ranges were 6.52–6.83 which are in the range of WHO standards.\n\n2. Hardness:\nHardness is mainly caused by calcium and magnesium salts. These salts are dissolved from geologic deposits through which water travels. The length of time water is in contact with hardness-producing material helps determine how much hardness there is in raw water. Hardness was originally defined as the capacity of water to precipitate soap caused by Calcium and Magnesium.\n\n3. Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS):\nWater has the ability to dissolve a wide range of inorganic and some organic minerals or salts such as potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, magnesium, sulfates, etc. These minerals produced an unwanted taste and diluted color in the appearance of water. This is the important parameter for the use of water. The water with a high TDS value indicates that water is highly mineralized. The desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and the maximum limit is 1000 mg/l which is prescribed for drinking purposes.\n\n4. Chloramines:\nChlorine and chloramine are the major disinfectants used in public water systems. Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water.\n\n5. Sulfate:\nSulfates are naturally occurring substances that are found in minerals, soil, and rocks. They are present in ambient air, groundwater, plants, and food. The principal commercial use of sulfate is in the chemical industry. Sulfate concentration in seawater is about 2,700 milligrams per liter (mg/L). It ranges from 3 to 30 mg/L in most freshwater supplies, although much higher concentrations (1000 mg/L) are found in some geographic locations.\n\n6. Conductivity:\nPure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather’s a good insulator. An increase in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally, the amount of dissolved solids in water determines electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to WHO standards, EC value should not exceed 400 μS/cm.\n\n7. Organic_carbon:\nTotal Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. TOC is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water. According to US EPA &lt; 2 mg/L as TOC in treated / drinking water, and &lt; 4 mg/Lit in source water which is use for treatment.\n\n8. Trihalomethanes:\nTHMs are chemicals that may be found in water treated with chlorine. The concentration of THMs in drinking water varies according to the level of organic material in the water, the amount of chlorine required to treat the water, and the temperature of the water that is being treated. THM levels up to 80 ppm are considered safe in drinking water.\n\n9. Turbidity:\nThe turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state. It is a measure of the light-emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the quality of waste discharge with respect to the colloidal matter. The mean turbidity value obtained for Wondo Genet Campus (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO recommended value of 5.00 NTU.\n\n10. Potability:\nIndicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.\n\nInspiration\nContaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to the transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks. This is particularly the case in health care facilities where both patients and staff are placed at additional risk of infection and disease when water, sanitation, and hygiene services are lacking.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/artimule/drinking-water-probability	{"health and fitness",healthcare,"public health","earth and nature",environment,health,energy}	{CC0-1.0}	{ph,Hardness,Solids,Chloramines,Sulfate,Conductivity,Organic_carbon,Trihalomethanes,Turbidity,Potability}	3276	10	32760	1434	0.7058823529411765

The vast majority of these deaths **(94%)** occurred in low-resource settings, and most **could have been prevented**.\n\n&gt; In light of what was mentioned above, **Cardiotocograms (CTGs)** are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n\n&gt; ## Data\nThis dataset contains **2126** records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into **3 classes**:\n- Normal\n- Suspect\n- Pathological\n\n\n# How to use\n&gt; - Create a multiclass model to classify CTG features into the three fetal health states.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\nAyres de Campos et al.

370	health	Health searches by US Metropolitan Area, 2005-2017	This is the Google Search interest data that powers the Visualisation [Searching For Health][1]. Google Trends data allows us to see what people are searching for at a very local level. This visualization tracks the top searches for common health issues in the United States, from Cancer to Diabetes, and compares them with the actual location of occurrences for those same health conditions to understand how search data reflects life for millions of Americans.\n\nHow does search interest for top health issues change over time? From 2004–2017, the data shows that search interest gradually increased over the past few years. Certain regions show a more significant increase in search interest than others. The increase in search activity is greatest in the Midwest and Northeast, while the changes are noticeably less dramatic in California, Texas, and Idaho. Are people generally becoming more aware of health conditions and health risks?\n\nThe search interest data was collected using the Google Trends API. The visualisation also brings in incidences of each condition so they can be compared. The health conditions were hand-selected from the Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) which provides key indicators for local communities in the United States. The CHSI dataset includes more than 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. More information about the CHSI can be found on healthdata.gov. \n\nMany striking similarities exist between searches and actual conditions—but the relationship between the Obesity and Diabetes maps stands out the most.\n“There are many risk factors for type 2 diabetes such as age, race, pregnancy, stress, certain medications, genetics or family history, high cholesterol and obesity. However, the single best predictor of type 2 diabetes is overweight or obesity. Almost 90% of people living with type 2 diabetes are overweight or have obesity. People who are overweight or have obesity have added pressure on their body's ability to use insulin to properly control blood sugar levels, and are therefore more likely to develop diabetes.” \n—Obesity Society via obesity.org\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.searching-for-health.com/	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/GoogleNewsLab/health-searches-us-county	{healthcare,diseases,health,internet}	{CC-BY-SA-4.0}	{ï»¿dma,geoCode,2004+cancer,2004+cardiovascular,2004+stroke,2004+depression,2004+rehab,2004+vaccine,2004+diarrhea,2004+obesity,2004+diabetes,2005+cancer,2005+cardiovascular,2005+stroke,2005+depression,2005+rehab,2005+vaccine,2005+diarrhea,2005+obesity,2005+diabetes,2006+cancer,2006+cardiovascular,2006+stroke,2006+depression,2006+rehab,2006+vaccine,2006+diarrhea,2006+obesity,2006+diabetes,2007+cancer,2007+cardiovascular,2007+stroke,2007+depression,2007+rehab,2007+vaccine,2007+diarrhea,2007+obesity,2007+diabetes,2008+cancer,2008+cardiovascular,2008+stroke,2008+depression,2008+rehab,2008+vaccine,2008+diarrhea,2008+obesity,2008+diabetes,2009+cancer,2009+cardiovascular,2009+stroke,2009+depression,2009+rehab,2009+vaccine,2009+diarrhea,2009+obesity,2009+diabetes,2010+cancer,2010+cardiovascular,2010+stroke,2010+depression,2010+rehab,2010+vaccine,2010+diarrhea,2010+obesity,2010+diabetes,2011+cancer,2011+cardiovascular,2011+stroke,2011+depression,2011+rehab,2011+vaccine,2011+diarrhea,2011+obesity,2011+diabetes,2012+cancer,2012+cardiovascular,2012+stroke,2012+depression,2012+rehab,2012+vaccine,2012+diarrhea,2012+obesity,2012+diabetes,2013+cancer,2013+cardiovascular,2013+stroke,2013+depression,2013+rehab,2013+vaccine,2013+diarrhea,2013+obesity,2013+diabetes,2014+cancer,2014+cardiovascular,2014+stroke,2014+depression,2014+rehab,2014+vaccine,2014+diarrhea,2014+obesity,2014+diabetes,2015+cancer,2015+cardiovascular,2015+stroke,2015+depression,2015+rehab,2015+vaccine,2015+diarrhea,2015+obesity,2015+diabetes,2016+cancer,2016+cardiovascular,2016+stroke,2016+depression,2016+rehab,2016+vaccine,2016+diarrhea,2016+obesity,2016+diabetes,2017+cancer,2017+cardiovascular,2017+stroke,2017+depression,2017+rehab,2017+vaccine,2017+diarrhea,2017+obesity,2017+diabetes}	210	128	26880	0	0.8235294117647058

375	health	Human Development Report 2015	# Content\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of achievements in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of education for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of education for children, and the standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) adjusts the HDI for inequality in the distribution of each dimension across the population.\n\nThe Gender Development Index (GDI) measures gender inequalities in achievement in three basic dimensions of human development: health, measured by female and male life expectancy at birth; education, measured by female and male expected years of education for children and female and male mean years of education for adults ages 25 and older; and command over economic resources, measured by female and male estimated earned income. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions—reproductive health, empowerment, and the labour market—for as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions.\n\nThe Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) identifies multiple deprivations at the household level in education, health, and standard of living as indicators of poverty. It uses micro data from household surveys, and — unlike the IHDI — all the indicators needed to construct the measure must come from the same survey.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/undp/human-development	{demographics,"international relations"}	{CC-BY-SA-4.0}	{"GDI Rank",Country,"Gender Development Index (GDI)","Human Development Index (Female)","Human Development Index (Male)","Life Expectancy at Birth (Female)","Life Expectancy at Birth (Male)","Expected Years of Education (Female)","Expected Years of Education (Male)","Mean Years of Education (Female)","Mean Years of Education (Male)","Estimated Gross National Income per Capita (Female)","Estimated Gross National Income per Capita (Male)","GII Rank","Gender Inequality Index (GII)","Maternal Mortality Ratio","Adolescent Birth Rate","Percent Representation in Parliament","Population with Secondary Education (Female)","Population with Secondary Education (Male)","Labour Force Participation Rate (Female)","Labour Force Participation Rate (Male)","HDI Rank","Human Development Index (1990)","Human Development Index (2000)","Human Development Index (2010)","Human Development Index (2011)","Human Development Index (2012)","Human Development Index (2013)","Human Development Index (2014)","Human Development Index (HDI)","Life Expectancy at Birth","Expected Years of Education","Mean Years of Education","Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita","GNI per Capita Rank Minus HDI Rank","IHDI Rank","Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI)","IHDI Loss Percent","IHDI Rank Difference","Coefficient of Human Inequality","Inequality in Life Expectancy","Inequality-Adjusted Life Expectancy Index","Inequality in Education","Inequality-Adjusted Education Index","Inequality in Income","Inequality-Adjusted Income Index","Income Inequality (Quintile Ratio)","Income Inequality (Palma Rati)","Income Inequality (Gini Coefficient)","Year and Survey","Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI, HDRO)","MPI HDRO Percent","Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI, 2010)","MPI 2010 Percent","Population in Multidimensional Poverty","Intensity of Deprivation","Education Deprivation","Health Deprivation","Living Standards","Population Below National Poverty Line","Population Below $1.25 per Day"}	1076	69	12233	74	0.8529411764705882

The dataset contains information on patient age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure levels, diabetic status, number of children, smoking status and region. By analyzing these key factors across geographical areas and across different demographics such as age or gender we can gain a greater understanding of who is most likely to receive an insurance claim. This understanding gives us valuable insight that can be used to inform our decision making when considering potential customers for our services. On a broader scale it can inform public policy by allowing for more targeted support for those who are most in need and vulnerable. These kinds of insights are extremely valuable and this dataset provides us with the tools we need to uncover them!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides a comprehensive examination of demographic and health data from insurance claims, which can be used to make predictions about a wide variety of health-related outcomes. It is designed to give users powerful insights into the relationship between different demographic factors such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure etc., the presence of chronic diseases like diabetes, smoking status and region with insurance claim amounts. \n> \n> In order to make use of this dataset for research purposes or machine learning applications like predictive analytics, it is important to take various factors into consideration while using it. The following are some tips on how to use this dataset: \n> - Make sure that you analyze all variables in relation with one another instead of treating them separately; this will help you understand how they interact and affect one another before creating models or drawing conclusions from the data. \n> - Observe any relationships among three or more variables together - e.g., what’s the correlation between age & gender vs claim amount? This can be done using multidimensional analysis methods like factor analysis (FA) or cluster analysis (CA).  \n> - Take into account hidden patterns in your dataset by looking for outliers or exceptions that might not otherwise be visible/apparent at first glance - these could signal unexpected influences on your variables when modeling/predicting results!  \n> - When applying regression models on this dataset keep in mind that its properties may change over time due to external conditions such as policy changes by insurers or general trends in claims; retrain your models periodically if necessary accordingly!  \n> 5 Finally when interpreting results obtained from analyzingthis datasets focus not only on numeric values but also try capturing qualitative characteristics so that you can get a deeper understanding about each variable influencing your prediction results!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Identifying trends in insurance claims based on age, gender, BMI, and blood pressure. \n> - Developing targeted marketing campaigns for customers at high risk of making an insurance claim. \n> - Investigating correlations between health traits (such as BMI and blood pressure) with the likelihood of making a claim\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/sumitrock)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: insurance_data.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                                              |\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Diabetic**  | Whether the insured person is diabetic or not.

380	health	Life Expectancy (WHO)	### Context\n\nAlthough there have been lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering                 demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. It was found that affect of immunization and human                development index was not taken into account in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple                    linear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries. Hence, this gives motivation to resolve both the                     factors stated previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression                 while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio                    and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors,                  economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on                   different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value                    of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently                    improve the life expectancy of its population. \n\n\n### Content\n\nThe project relies on accuracy of data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health                 Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The data-sets                    are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors                    for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic                 data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. It has been observed that in the past 15 years , there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing  nations in comparison to the past 30 years.  Therefore, in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The                  individual data files have been merged together into a single data-set. On initial visual inspection of the data showed some                    missing values. As the data-sets were from WHO, we found no evident errors. Missing data was handled in R software by                     using Missmap command. The result indicated that most of the missing data was for population, Hepatitis B and GDP. The                    missing data were from less known countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, Togo, Cabo Verde etc. Finding all data for these                  countries was difficult and hence, it was decided that we exclude these countries from the final model data-set. The final                    merged file(final dataset) consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows which meant 20 predicting variables. All predicting                 variables was then divided into several broad categories:​Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical              factors and Social factors.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data was collected from WHO and United Nations website with the help of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe data-set aims to answer the following key questions: \n1. Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? What are the                predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy? \n2. Should a country having a lower life expectancy value(&lt;65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan? \n3. How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy? \n4. Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking               alcohol etc. \n5. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans? \n6. Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol? \n7. Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy? \n8. What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy? 	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who	{global,health,"social science","data cleaning"}	{other}	{Country,Year,Status,"Life expectancy ","Adult Mortality","infant deaths",Alcohol,"percentage expenditure","Hepatitis B","Measles "," BMI ","under-five deaths ",Polio,"Total expenditure","Diphtheria "," HIV/AIDS",GDP,Population," thinness  1-19 years"," thinness 5-9 years","Income composition of resources",Schooling}	2938	22	64636	2563	0.8235294117647058

If  you are interested also try on your own model to test.  \n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nDataSprint-IIMV\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/ron2112/mental-health-data	{"mental health"}	{unknown}	{"Are you self-employed?","How many employees does your company or organization have?","Is your employer primarily a tech company/organization?","Is your primary role within your company related to tech/IT?","Does your employer provide mental health benefits as part of healthcare coverage?","Do you know the options for mental health care available under your employer-provided coverage?","Has your employer ever formally discussed mental health (for example, as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)?","Does your employer offer resources to learn more about mental health concerns and options for seeking help?","If a mental health issue prompted you to request a medical leave from work, asking for that leave would be:","Would you feel comfortable discussing a mental health disorder with your coworkers?","Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?","Do you know local or online resources to seek help for a mental health disorder?","Do you believe your productivity is ever affected by a mental health issue?","If yes, what percentage of your work time (time performing primary or secondary job functions) is affected by a mental health issue?","How willing would you be to share with friends and family that you have a mental illness?","Do you have a family history of mental illness?","Have you had a mental health disorder in the past?","Do you currently have a mental health disorder?","Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?","If so, what condition(s) were you diagnosed with?","Have you ever sought treatment for a mental health issue from a mental health professional?","If you have a mental health issue, do you feel that it interferes with your work when being treated effectively?","If you have a mental health issue, do you feel that it interferes with your work when NOT being treated effectively?","What is your age?","What is your gender?","What country do you live in?","What US state or territory do you live in?","What country do you work in?","What US state or territory do you work in?","Which of the following best describes your work position?","Do you work remotely?"}	1433	31	44423	9307	0.47058823529411764
387	health	Mental Health FAQ for Chatbot	### Content\n\nMental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Mental health is integral to living a healthy, balanced life. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Emotional and mental health is important because it’s a vital part of your life and impacts your thoughts, behaviors and emotions. Being healthy emotionally can promote productivity and effectiveness in activities like work, school or care-giving. It plays an important part in the health of your relationships, and allows you to adapt to changes in your life and cope with adversity. Mental health problems are common but help is available. People with mental health problems can get better and many recover completely. \n\nThis dataset consists of FAQs about Mental Health.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nhttps://www.thekimfoundation.org/faqs/\n\nhttps://www.mhanational.org/frequently-asked-questions\n\nhttps://www.wellnessinmind.org/frequently-asked-questions/\n\nhttps://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/questions-and-answers	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/narendrageek/mental-health-faq-for-chatbot	{"mental health",beginner,nlp,text}	{other}	{Question_ID,Questions,Answers}	98	3	294	0	1

390	health	Mental Health	Mental health is an essential part of people’s lives and society. Poor mental health affects our well-being, our ability to work, and our relationships with friends, family, and community.\n\nMental health conditions are not uncommon. Hundreds of millions suffer from them yearly, and many more do over their lifetimes. It’s estimated that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men will experience major depression in their lives. Other conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are less common but still have a large impact on people’s lives.\n\n**Mental health data based on surveys**\nAside from the formal diagnoses, mental illnesses can be measured using surveys and screening questionnaires.\nThese tend to ask people about symptoms similar to those in diagnostic manuals, but they can be used more easily and widely because the data does not need to be collected by a healthcare professional.\n\n**What are the strengths and limitations of survey data?**\nStrengths of survey data\nSurvey data on mental health has two major strengths.\nFirst, it involves structured interviews – people are asked a consistent set of questions regardless of their interviewer. This helps to ensure the data is more comparable between interviewers and across time.12\nSecond, surveys include a much wider range of people in the population, including those who would not seek treatment due to a lack of awareness, costs, or other concerns.\n\nLimitations of survey data\n\nThere are also several limitations of survey data to keep in mind.\nOne is that people may not share their symptoms in surveys, as they may not feel comfortable sharing them with researchers. Along with this, people’s comfort in sharing mental health symptoms may vary between countries and over time.16\nAnother limitation is that people may not remember their symptoms, especially when they are asked to recall symptoms in their lifetime so far. This can be challenging for older people whose symptoms may have occurred decades ago.\n\nBy Saloni Dattani	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/mental-health	{"mental health"}	{other}	{Entity,Code,Year,"Schizophrenia disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Depressive disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Anxiety disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Bipolar disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","Eating disorders (share of population) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Depressive disorders","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Schizophrenia","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Bipolar disorder","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Eating disorders","DALYs (rate) - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized - Cause: Anxiety disorders","Major depression","Bipolar disorder","Eating disorders",Dysthymia,Schizophrenia,"Anxiety disorders","Potentially adequate treatment, conditional","Other treatments, conditional","Untreated, conditional","Nearly every day","More than half the days","Several days","Not at all","Number of countries with primary data on prevalence of mental disorders"}	13355	46	106652	1034	0.7058823529411765

MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.\n\nHowever, MT employs a wide range of different genres, varying from one organization to the next.\n\nThe **MxMH** dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind.\n\n# Interpreting data\n\n### Block 0: Background\nRespondents answer generic questions focused on musical background and listening habits.\n\n### Block 1: Music genres\nRespondents rank how often they listen to 16 music genres, where they can select:\n* Never\n* Rarely\n* Sometimes\n* Very frequently\n\n### Block 2: Mental health\nRespondents rank Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD on a scale of 0 to 10, where:\n* 0 - I do not experience this.\n* 10 - I experience this regularly, constantly/or to an extreme.\n\n*Additional data that does not fall in these blocks may provide useful background information. See column descriptors.*\n\n# Data collection\nData collection was managed by @catherinerasgaitis via a Google Form. Respondents were not restricted by age or location.\n\nThe form was posted in various Reddit forums, Discord servers, and social media platforms. Posters and "business cards" were also used to advertise the form in libraries, parks, and other public locations.\n\nThe form was relatively brief so that respondents would be more likely finish the survey. "Harder" questions (such as BPM) were left optional for the same reason.\n\nView the [EDA notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/catherinerasgaitis/music-mental-health-eda/notebook).	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results	{music,"mental health","data visualization","data analytics"}	{CC0-1.0}	{Timestamp,Age,"Primary streaming service","Hours per day","While working",Instrumentalist,Composer,"Fav genre",Exploratory,"Foreign languages",BPM,"Frequency [Classical]","Frequency [Country]","Frequency [EDM]","Frequency [Folk]","Frequency [Gospel]","Frequency [Hip hop]","Frequency [Jazz]","Frequency [K pop]","Frequency [Latin]","Frequency [Lofi]","Frequency [Metal]","Frequency [Pop]","Frequency [R&B]","Frequency [Rap]","Frequency [Rock]","Frequency [Video game music]",Anxiety,Depression,Insomnia,OCD,"Music effects",Permissions}	736	33	24288	129	1

However, NFHS-5 includes some new topics, such as preschool education, disability, access to a toilet facility, death registration, bathing practices during menstruation, and methods and reasons for abortion. The scope of clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical testing has also been expanded to include the measurement of waist and hip circumferences and the age range for the measurement of blood pressure and blood glucose has been expanded. However, HIV testing has been dropped. The NFHS-5 sample has been designed to provide national, state, and union territory, and district-level estimates of various indicators covered in the survey. However, estimates of indicators of sexual behavior, husband's background and woman's work, HIV and AIDS knowledge, attitudes and behavior, and domestic violence are available only at the state and

395	health	National Nutritional Survey 	Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS), was the largest micronutrient survey ever implemented globally. The survey used gold standard methods to assess anemia, micronutrient deficiencies and biomarkers of NCDs for the first time in India.The Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS), the first ever nationally representative nutrition survey of children and adolescents in India, was successfully completed due to the efforts and involvement of numerous organizations and individuals at various stages of the survey.To provide robust data on the shifting conditions of both undernutrition and overweight and obesity, the Ministry of Health conducted the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) to collect a comprehensive set of data on nutritional status of Indian children from 0â‚¬â€œ19 years of age. The Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS), provides national and state level representative data for nutritional status and micronutrient deficiencies among children and adolescents from birth to 19 years and estimates of biomarkers for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among those aged 5-19 years. The aim was to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition among children and adolescents and to identify key factors associated with the nutrition transition in India by using robust tools and gold standard methods to reorient national programme and policy.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/zsinghrahulk/national-nutritional-survey	{nutrition,health}	{CC0-1.0}	{Rowid,Country,"State lgd

The major wars that have happened during their tenure as POTUS.\n\n\nThe Office of the President of the United States (POTUS) was established by the US Constitution in 1789, with George Washington being elected as the first US president. At the time of his presidency, the role of POTUS was largely ceremonial and focused on the administration of the federal government. However, over time, the position grew in power and influence as the US became a global superpower and the demands of the post changed. With the expansion of the executive branch of the government and the development of modern communication and transportation technologies, the role of POTUS became even more significant. The US president now plays a central role in shaping policy, implementing agendas, and representing the country on the world stage. Throughout history, the POTUS has also been involved in many historical events and crises, such as the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War II, the civil rights movement, and the War on Terror. Each president has brought their unique set of values, leadership style, and vision for the country, shaping the office and the nation in their own way.\n\nThe POTUS is the most powerful political figure in the United States, responsible for shaping domestic and foreign policy, appointing federal judges and other officials, and representing the country both at home and abroad. The US president is elected to a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two terms under the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution. The role and responsibilities of the POTUS have evolved over time, reflecting the changing needs and expectations of the American people and the world at large.\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/zsinghrahulk/us-presidents-age-state-health-and-wealth	{government}	{CC0-1.0}	{ï»¿No.,President,Born,"start of presidency","end of presidency",Post-presidency,Died,Age,"Net worth((millions of 2022 US$))","Political party[11]","Years in office",IQ,"Height (ft)","Height (cm)","Weight (lbs)","Number of kids","Number of marriages",State,"Ethnic Origin",Religion(s),"% of Budget Allocated to Defense","Wars During Tenure",Education,Degree}	46	24	1104	57	1
402	health	Power Transform_ Health index	The Power transformers are the most vital and critical equipment in the power system, their role is to ensure an uninterrupted power supply in the installation, however, several types of faults could render a power transformer unusable or severely underrated, in the scenario, all the faults need to be monitored to ensure reliability of power supply. Due to failure modes, a root cause analysis is necessary for improving the diagnosis and analysis, likewise the new technology with artificial intelligence is important to create a new value for the company and to increase the accuracy and efficiency. Whenever a fault occurs in a transformer, gases such as CO2, CH4, C2H6, CO, H2, O2, N2, among others. Some of these gases barring CO2, N2 and O2 get absorbed in the transformer oil. Concentration of these gases in the dielectric oil can be measured as parts per million or ppm. This paper proposes an online learning based adaptive classifier. Proposal is to use a genetic algorithm, it based on action selection mechanism in a neural network reinforcement learning setup.\n\n***https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rz75w3fkxy***	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehpanahandeh/power-transform-health-index	{physics}	{unknown}	{Hydrogen,Oxigen,Nitrogen,Methane,CO,CO2,Ethylene,Ethane,Acethylene,DBDS,Power_factor,Interfacial_V,Dielectric_rigidity,Water_content,Health_index,Life_expectation}	470	16	7520	0	0.47058823529411764

It includes information on age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure values, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking habits and alcohol consumption of over 70 thousand individuals. Additionally it outlines if the person is active or not and if he or she has any cardiovascular diseases. This dataset provides a great resource for researchers to apply modern machine learning techniques to explore the potential relations between risk factors and cardiovascular disease that can ultimately lead to improved understanding of this serious health issue and design better preventive measures\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset can be used to explore the risk factors of cardiovascular disease in adults. The aim is to understand how certain demographic factors, health behaviors and biological markers affect the development of heart disease. \n>  \n> To start, look through the columns of data and familiarize yourself with each one.

415	health	US Health Insurance Dataset	### Context\n\nThe venerable insurance industry is no stranger to data driven decision making. Yet in today's rapidly transforming digital landscape, Insurance is struggling to adapt and benefit from new technologies compared to other industries, even within the BFSI sphere (compared to the Banking sector for example.) Extremely complex underwriting rule-sets that are radically different in different product lines, many non-KYC environments with a lack of centralized customer information base, complex relationship with consumers in traditional risk underwriting where sometimes customer centricity runs reverse to business profit, inertia of regulatory compliance  - are some of the unique challenges faced by Insurance Business.\n\nDespite this, emergent technologies like AI and Block Chain have brought a radical change in Insurance, and Data Analytics sits at the core of this transformation. We can identify 4 key factors behind the emergence of Analytics as a crucial part of InsurTech:\n\n - **Big Data:** The explosion of unstructured data in the form of images, videos, text, emails, social media\n - **AI:** The recent advances in Machine Learning and Deep Learning that can enable businesses to gain insight, do predictive analytics and build cost and time - efficient innovative solutions\n - **Real time Processing:** Ability of real time information processing through various data feeds (for ex. social media, news)\n - **Increased Computing Power:** a complex ecosystem of new analytics vendors and solutions that enable carriers to combine data sources, external insights, and advanced modeling techniques in order to glean insights that were not possible before.\n\nThis dataset can be helpful in a simple yet illuminating study in understanding the risk underwriting in Health Insurance, the interplay of various attributes of the insured and see how they affect the insurance premium.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains 1338 rows of insured data, where the Insurance charges are given against the following attributes of the insured: Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoker and Region. There are no missing or undefined values in the dataset.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis relatively simple dataset should be an excellent starting point for EDA, Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis testing and training Linear Regression models for predicting Insurance Premium Charges.\n\nProposed Tasks:\n - Exploratory Data Analytics\n - Statistical hypothesis testing\n - Statistical Modeling\n - Linear Regression	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset	{finance,insurance}	{CC0-1.0}	{age,sex,bmi,children,smoker,region,charges}	1338	7	9366	0	0.9411764705882353
416	health	U.S. Household Mental Health & Covid-19	_____\n# U.S. Household Mental Health & Covid-19\n### Assessing the Impact of the Pandemic\nBy US Open Data Portal, data.gov [[source]](https://data.world/datagov-us)\n_____\n\n### About this dataset\n> This dataset offers a closer look into the mental health care received by U.S. households in the last four weeks during the Covid-19 pandemic. The sheer scale of this crisis is inspiring people of all ages, backgrounds, and geographies to come together to tackle the problem. The Household Pulse Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau was published with federal agency collaboration in order to draw up accurate and timely estimates about how Covid-19 is impacting employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing stability, education interruption, and physical and mental wellness amongst American households. In order to deliver meaningful results from this survey data about wellbeing at various levels of society during this trying period – which includes demographic characteristics such as age gender race/ethnicity training attainment – each consulted household was randomly selected according to certain weighted criteria to maintain accuracy throughout the findings This dataset will help you explore what's it like on the ground right now for everyone affected by Covid-19 - Will it inform your decisions or point you towards new opportunities?\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset contains information about the mental health care that U.S. households have received in the last 4 weeks, during the Covid-19 pandemic. This data is valuable when wanting to track and measure mental health needs across the country and draw comparisons between regions based on support available. \n> \n> To use this dataset, it is important to understand each of its columns or variables in order to draw meaningful insights from the data. The ‘Indicator’ column indicates which type of indicator (percentage or absolute number) is being measured by this survey, while ‘Group’ and 'Subgroup' provide more specific details about who was surveyed for each indicator included in this dataset. \n> \n> The Columns ‘Phase’ and 'Time Period' provide information regarding when each of these indicators was measured - whether during a certain phase or over a particular timespan - while columns such as 'Value', 'LowCI' & 'HighCI' show us how many individuals fell into what quartile range for each measurement taken (e.g., how many people reported they rarely felt lonely). Similarly, the column Suppression Flag helps us identify cases where value has been suppressed if it falls below a certain benchmark; this allows us to calculate accurate estimates more quickly without needing to sort through all suppressed values manually each time we use this dataset for analysis purposes. \n> Finally, columns such as ‘Time Period Start Date’ & ‘Time Period End Date’ indicate which exact dates were used for measurements taken over different periods throughout those dates specified – useful when conducting time-series related analyses over longer periods of time within our research scope)   \n> \n> Overall, when using this dataset it's important to keep in mind exactly what indicator type you're looking at - percentage points or absolute numbers - as well its associated group/subgroup characteristics so that you can accurately interpret trends based on key findings had by interpreting any correlations drawn from these results!\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health care among different subgroups such as racial and ethnic minorities, gender and age categories. \n> - Identifying geographical disparities in mental health services by comparing state level data for the same time period.\n> - Comparing changes in mental health care indicators over time to understand how the pandemic has impacted people's access to care within a quarter or over longer periods\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://data.world/datagov-us)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [Dataset copyright by authors](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**\n> - You are free to:\n>      - **Share** - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\n>      - **Adapt** - remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n> - You must:\n>      - **Give appropriate credit** - Provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\n>      - **ShareAlike** - You must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.\n>      - **Keep intact** - all notices that refer to this license, including copyright notices.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: csv-1.csv**\n| Column name                | Description                                                                                    |\n|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Indicator**              | The indicator being measured.

418	health	Water Quality	# Context\n\n`Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.`\n\n\n# Content\n\n\nThe water_potability.csv file contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. \n### 1. pH value:\n```PH is an important parameter in evaluating the acid–base balance of water. It is also the indicator of acidic or alkaline condition of water status. WHO has recommended maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The current investigation ranges were 6.52–6.83 which are in the range of WHO standards. ```\n\n### 2. Hardness:\n```Hardness is mainly caused by calcium and magnesium salts. These salts are dissolved from geologic deposits through which water travels. The length of time water is in contact with hardness producing material helps determine how much hardness there is in raw water.\nHardness was originally defined as the capacity of water to precipitate soap caused by Calcium and Magnesium.```\n\n### 3. Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS): \n```Water has the ability to dissolve a wide range of inorganic and some organic minerals or salts such as potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, magnesium, sulfates etc. These minerals produced un-wanted taste and diluted color in appearance of water. This is the important parameter for the use of water. The water with high TDS value indicates that water is highly mineralized. Desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and maximum limit is 1000 mg/l which prescribed for drinking purpose. ```\n\n### 4. Chloramines: \n```Chlorine and chloramine are the major disinfectants used in public water systems. Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water.```\n\n### 5. Sulfate: \n```Sulfates are naturally occurring substances that are found in minerals, soil, and rocks. They are present in ambient air, groundwater, plants, and food. The principal commercial use of sulfate is in the chemical industry. Sulfate concentration in seawater is about 2,700 milligrams per liter (mg/L). It ranges from 3 to 30 mg/L in most freshwater supplies, although much higher concentrations (1000 mg/L) are found in some geographic locations. ```\n\n### 6. Conductivity: \n```Pure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather’s a good insulator. Increase in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally, the amount of dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to WHO standards, EC value should not exceeded 400 μS/cm. ```\n\n### 7. Organic_carbon: \n ```Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. TOC is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water. According to US EPA &lt; 2 mg/L as TOC in treated / drinking water, and &lt; 4 mg/Lit in source water which is use for treatment.```\n\n### 8. Trihalomethanes: \n```THMs are chemicals which may be found in water treated with chlorine. The concentration of THMs in drinking water varies according to the level of organic material in the water, the amount of chlorine required to treat the water, and the temperature of the water that is being treated. THM levels up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.```\n\n### 9. Turbidity: \n```The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state. It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the quality of waste discharge with respect to colloidal matter. The mean turbidity value obtained for Wondo Genet Campus (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO recommended value of 5.00 NTU.```\n\n### 10. Potability: \n```Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.```	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability	{"water bodies","public health","earth and nature",environment,energy,beginner,"binary classification"}	{CC0-1.0}	{ph,Hardness,Solids,Chloramines,Sulfate,Conductivity,Organic_carbon,Trihalomethanes,Turbidity,Potability}	3276	10	32760	1434	1

There are countries/regions in the World Bank data not in the Covid-19 data, and countries/regions in the Covid-19 data with no World Bank data. This is unavoidable.\n2. There were political decisions made in both datasets that may cause problems. I chose to go forward with the data as presented, and did not attempt to modify the decisions made by the dataset creators (e.g., the names of countries, what is and is not a country, etc.).\n\n\nColumns are as follows:\n1. Country_Region: the region as used in Kaggle Covid-19 spread data challenges.\n2. Province_State: the region as used in Kaggle Covid-19 spread data challenges.\n3. World_Bank_Name: the name of the country used by the World Bank\n4. Health_exp_pct_GDP_2016: Level of current health expenditure expressed as a percentage of GDP.

They do not include external resources spent by governments on health.\n\n6. Health_exp_out_of_pocket_pct_2016: Share of out-of-pocket payments of total current health expenditures.  Out-of-pocket payments are spending on health directly out-of-pocket by households.\n\n7. Health_exp_per_capita_USD_2016: Current expenditures on health per capita in current US dollars. Estimates of current health expenditures include healthcare goods and services consumed during each year.\n\n8. per_capita_exp_PPP_2016: Current expenditures on health per capita expressed in international dollars at purchasing power parity (PPP).\n\n9. External_health_exp_pct_2016: Share of current health expenditures funded from external sources. External sources compose of direct foreign transfers and foreign transfers distributed by government encompassing all financial inflows into the national health system from outside the country. External sources either flow through the government scheme or are channeled through non-governmental organizations or other schemes.\n\n10. Physicians_per_1000_2009-18: Physicians include generalist and specialist medical practitioners.\n\n11. Nurse_midwife_per_1000_2009-18: Nurses and midwives include professional nurses, professional midwives, auxiliary nurses, auxiliary midwives, enrolled nurses, enrolled midwives and other associated personnel, such as dental nurses and primary care nurses.\n\n12. Specialist_surgical_per_1000_2008-18: Specialist surgical workforce is the number of specialist surgical, anaesthetic, and obstetric (SAO) providers who are working in each country per 100,000 population.\n\n13. Completeness_of_birth_reg_2009-18: Completeness of birth registration is the percentage of children under age 5 whose births were registered at the time of the survey. The numerator of completeness of birth registration includes children whose birth certificate was seen by the interviewer or whose mother or caretaker says the birth has been registered.\n\n14. Completeness_of_death_reg_2008-16: Completeness of death registration is the estimated percentage of deaths that are registered with their cause of death information in the vital registration system of a country.\n\nWhat's inside is more than just rows and columns. Make it easy for others to get started by describing how you acquired the data and what time period it represents, too.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nDoes health spending levels (public or private), or hospital staff have any effect on the rate at which Covid-19 spreads in a country?

The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.\n\n### Content\n\nThe happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.\n\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021	{healthcare,"religion and belief systems",health,economics,beginner}	{CC0-1.0}	{"ï»¿Country name","Regional indicator","Ladder score","Standard error of ladder score",upperwhisker,lowerwhisker,"Logged GDP per capita","Social support","Healthy life expectancy","Freedom to make life choices",Generosity,"Perceptions of corruption","Ladder score in Dystopia","Explained by: Log GDP per capita","Explained by: Social support","Explained by: Healthy life expectancy","Explained by: Freedom to make life choices","Explained by: Generosity","Explained by: Perceptions of corruption","Dystopia + residual",year,"Life Ladder","Log GDP per capita","Healthy life expectancy at birth","Positive affect","Negative affect"}	2098	31	24419	373	0.9705882352941176

423	health	World Sanitation & Health	### Context\n\nIn 2010, the UN General Assembly recognized access to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right, and called for international efforts to help countries to provide safe, clean, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation.\nSustainable Development Goal target 6.2 calls for adequate and equitable sanitation for all. The target is tracked with the indicator of “safely managed sanitation services” – use of an improved type of sanitation facility that is not shared with other households and from which the excreta produced are either safely treated in situ, or transported and treated off-site. \n\nSome 827 000 people in low- and middle-income countries die as a result of inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene each year, representing 60% of total diarrhoeal deaths. Poor sanitation is believed to be the main cause in some 432 000 of these deaths.\n\nDiarrhea remains a major killer but is largely preventable. Better water, sanitation, and hygiene could prevent the deaths of 297 000 children aged under 5 years each year.\n\nOpen defecation perpetuates a vicious cycle of disease and poverty. The countries where open defection is most widespread have the highest number of deaths of children aged under 5 years as well as the highest levels of malnutrition and poverty, and big disparities of wealth.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nGiven the importance of sanitation in the spread of a disease, we need to make sure everyone has access to proper measures required. Different countries have different facilities and policies regarding the same. We can answer questions pertaining to the issue - which country has the least hygienic measures? which country has faced major diseases due to inadequate facilities? etc.\n\nFeel free to answer your questions based on the research. I hope you find answers of relevance.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/navinmundhra/world-sanitation	{"public health",education,energy,"public safety"}	{"Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO)"}	{Indicator,"PUBLISH STATES",Year,"WHO region",Country,"Residence Area Type","Display Value",Numeric,Low,High,Comments}	38805	44	426855	118537	0.9117647058823529

442	finance	Bitcoin-USD Dataset from Yahoo Finance (1 Year)	This project is for educational purposes.\n\nThis is a Machine Learning Application using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. The RNN was implemented using Long Short-term memory (LSTM) cells. This type of deep learning algorithm is best suited for the situation given that the data input is a time series and the goal is to predict future Bitcoin prices. The LSTM model is a type of RNN model which means it process' past information to make future predictions. An advantage that comes with using the LSTM model is that it can better handle dealing with relationships in data that were seperated by long periods of time. For example, cryptocurrency traders might wonder if an event that happened 2 weeks ago had any affect on todays data of Bitcoin prices. The LSTM model can better handle this scenario and will prove to be one of the better options of RNN architecture for predicting future Bitcoin prices.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/harshadpawar/bitcoinusd-dataset-from-yahoo-finance-1-year	{"computer science","currencies and foreign exchange"}	{GPL-2.0}	{Date,Open,High,Low,Close,"Adj Close",Volume}	366	7	2562	18	0.7058823529411765

846	chemistry	Wine Quality Data Set (Red & White Wine)	### Data Set Information\n\nThis data set contains records related to red and white variants of the Portuguese *[Vinho Verde](https://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/)* wine. It contains information from 1599 red wine samples and 4898 white wine samples. Input variables in the data set consist of the type of wine (either red or white wine) and metrics from objective tests (e.g. acidity levels, PH values, ABV, etc.), while the target/output variable is a numerical score based on sensory data—median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Due to privacy and logistic issues, there is no data about grape types, wine brand, and wine selling price.\n\nThis data set is a *combined* version of the two separate files (distinct red and white wine data sets) originally shared in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).\n\nThe following are some existing data sets on Kaggle from the same source (with notable differences from this data set):\n- [Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) (contains **red wine data only**)\n- [Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality) (combination of red and white wine data but with **some values randomly removed**)\n- [Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/danielpanizzo/wine-quality) (red and white wine data **not combined**)\n \n\n### Contents\n\nInput variables:\n\n1 - type of wine: type of wine (categorical: 'red', 'white')\n\n(continuous variables based on physicochemical tests)\n\n2 - fixed acidity: The acids that naturally occur in the grapes used to ferment the wine and carry over into the wine. They mostly consist of tartaric, malic, citric or succinic acid that mostly originate from the grapes used to ferment the wine. They also do not evaporate easily. (g / dm^3)\n\n3 - volatile acidity: Acids that evaporate at low temperatures—mainly acetic acid which can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar-like taste at very high levels. (g / dm^3)\n\n4 - citric acid: Citric acid is used as an acid supplement which boosts the acidity of the wine. It's typically found in small quantities and can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines. (g / dm^3)\n\n5 - residual sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. It's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter. Wines residual sugar level greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet. On the other end of the spectrum, a wine that does not taste sweet is considered as dry. (g / dm^3)\n\n6 - chlorides: The amount of chloride salts (sodium chloride) present in the wine. (g / dm^3)\n\n7 - free sulfur dioxide: The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine. All else constant, the higher the free sulfur dioxide content, the stronger the preservative effect. (mg / dm^3)\n\n8 - total sulfur dioxide: The amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine. (mg / dm^3)\n\n9 - density: The density of wine juice depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content; it's typically similar but higher than that of water (wine is 'thicker'). (g / cm^3)\n\n10 - pH: A measure of the acidity of wine; most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale. The lower the pH, the more acidic the wine is; the higher the pH, the less acidic the wine. (The pH scale technically is a logarithmic scale that measures the concentration of free hydrogen ions floating around in your wine. Each point of the pH scale is a factor of 10. This means a wine with a pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than a wine with a pH of 4)\n\n11 - sulphates: Amount of potassium sulphate as a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels; it acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent.(g / dm3)\n\n12 - alcohol: How much alcohol is contained in a given volume of wine (ABV). Wine generally contains between 5–15% of alcohols. (% by volume)\n\nOutput variable:\n\n13 - quality: score between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent) by wine experts\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nSource: P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T.

Visit their website to access the original data set directly: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality\n\n\n### Context\n\nSo much about wine making remains elusive—taste is very subjective, making it extremely challenging to predict exactly how consumers will react to a certain bottle of wine. There is no doubt that winemakers, connoisseurs, and scientists have greatly contributed their expertise to the process, but there is still more to be discovered about the art and science of winemaking. Use this data to gain a better understanding of what makes a good quality or bad quality wine *according to wine experts' taste-buds and brains*.\n\nThe data set can be used to solve classification or regression tasks. Note that the classes are ordered and **not balanced** (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Moreover, some input variables may or may not be relevant—it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/ruthgn/wine-quality-data-set-red-white-wine	{alcohol,"arts and entertainment",chemistry,business,regression}	{"Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)"}	{type,"fixed acidity","volatile acidity","citric acid","residual sugar",chlorides,"free sulfur dioxide","total sulfur dioxide",density,pH,sulphates,alcohol,quality}	6497	13	84461	0	1

450	finance	Chinese Debt Trap	Debt-trap diplomacy is a term in international finance which describes a creditor country or institution extending debt to a borrowing nation partially, or solely, to increase the lender's political leverage. The term was coined by Indian academic Brahma Chellaney.\n\nThe creditor country is said to extend excessive credit to a debtor country with the intention of extracting economic or political concessions when the debtor country becomes unable to meet its repayment obligations.The conditions of the loans are often not publicized, and benefit the lender. The borrowed money commonly pays for contractors and materials sourced from the creditor country. Although the term is most commonly associated with China, it has also been applied to the International Monetary Fund (IMF); both allegations, however, are disputed. The term "debt-trap diplomacy" began to be used in United States government documents during the Trump administration. A number of U.S. government documents refer to it, including the 2020 Department of State report "The Elements of the China Challenge".\n\n<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSSS5wVAPTMpMwBytqo9KRWTLqJUfsRdOFtlQ&usqp=CAU">	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/chinese-debt-trap	{geography,finance,government,lending,economics}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Expand All | Collapse All",YEAR,AMOUNT,LENDER,BORROWER,SECTOR,"SENSITIVE TERRITORY OVERLAP",Country,S.no,Project,Year,Lender,"$ Allocation","Invested On"}	2046	15	15180	1	1

DOF uses income information from rental properties similar in physical features and location to the condominiums or cooperatives. DOF applies this income data to the condominium or cooperative to determine its value in the same way DOF values rental apartment buildings. This report includes information at a condominium suffix level which represents a subdivision of the condominium since DOF values condominiums at a suffix level. A condominium may have more than one suffix.\n\n### Content\n\nThis data set contains the reports from 2012-2018.\n**Boro-Block-Lot**\t\nThe Borough-Block-Lot location of the subject condominium.

From the Gender and Card type used to carry out each transaction, to which city saw the highest amount of spending and even what kind of expenses were made, this dataset paints an overall picture about how money is being spent in India today. With its variety in variables, researchers have an opportunity to uncover deeper trends in customer spending as well as interesting correlations between data points that can serve as invaluable business intelligence. Whether you're interested in learning more about customer preferences or simply exploring unbiased data analysis techniques, this data is sure to provide insight beyond what one could anticipate\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset \n&gt; - To get started with this dataset, you first need to select the columns you want to analyze. Once your columns are selected, use pivot tables to create a summary of the total amount spent by month or city or other parameters of analysis. Some suggested analysis would include factors such as gender, seasonality/timing of spending etc which can help to better understand Indian consumer behaviour related to credit cards as well as provide insights into personal finance management that could be useful for improved financial decisions.  \n&gt; - Once a summary table is created from the selected columns it could be useful to add more detailed breakdowns by combining multiple criteria such as ‘amount’ with ‘expense type’ or ‘date’ etc., this way more informative visuals and summaries can be generated which could then again help in forming better conclusions about financial habits within India related to Credit Card usage trends and recommendations for future improvement measures if needed .  \n&gt; - Additionally , if available other external information (i.e population size/density/income levels etc.)could also be compared with these findings so further actionable areas of focus can be identified on an overall level or credited towards specific buyer personas / cities etc.\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - To analyze consumer trends and interests by looking at the type of purchases people make based on their gender and city. \n&gt; - To detect potential credit card fraud or malicious activity, such as by analyzing changes in spending habits or unusual purchases, by city and gender. \n&gt; - To predict spending patterns for promotional campaigns, such as during festivals or holidays, in order to better target customer segments according to city and gender based spending habits\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/ash018)\n&gt;  \n\n### License \n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Credit card transactions - India - Simple.csv**\n| Column name   | Description                                                   |\n|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **City**      | The city in which the transaction took place.

Secondary education constitutes secondary general education, secondary vocational education (MBO) and adult education. Tertiary education encompasses higher professional education (HBO) and university education (WO).\nAll educational institutions are funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science as of 2018. Educational institutions that provided agricultural education were funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs until 2018. Educational institutions are legally obligated to annually submit their financial statements before the 1st of July to the Education Executive Agency (DUO) of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. The data from the financial statements is subsequently processed by DUO and transmitted to Statistics Netherlands.\nFinancial information regarding primary educational institutions is available from 2006 onwards, as a result of the introduction of lump sum funding in the same year, which legally obligated these institutions to provide their financial information to the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. The finances for the educational institutions in the secondary and tertiary education are available since 1998. Financial information related to special-needs educational institutions is available separately and concerns the educational institutions with school boards solely overseeing special-needs education in both primary and secondary education. Please note that the educational institutions of Caribbean Netherlands are included in the table from 2010 onwards, due to the islands of Caribbean Netherlands becoming part of the Netherlands as of October 2010.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/niramay/educational-institutes-and-finances	{education}	{"Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)"}	{"ï»¿\\"ID\\";\\"EducationSectors\\";\\"Periods\\";\\"OperatingIncome_1\\";\\"GrantsFromTheState_2\\";\\"OtherGovernmentalGrants_3\\";\\"TuitionAndExamFees_4\\";\\"IncomeFromContractsWithThirdParties_5\\";\\"OtherIncome_6\\";\\"OperatingCosts_7\\";\\"PersonnelCosts_8\\";\\"Depreciation_9\\";\\"HousingCosts_10\\";\\"TotalOtherCosts_11\\";\\"AdministrativeCosts_12\\";\\"InventoryMaterialAndTeachingAid_13\\";\\"Other_14\\";\\"OperatingResult1_15\\";\\"NetFinancialCosts2_16\\";\\"SpecialEntries3_17\\";\\"Result123_18\\";\\"TotalAssets_19\\";\\"TotalFixedAssets_20\\";\\"NonFinancialIntangibleFixedAssets_21\\";\\"TotalNonFinancialTangibleFixedAs_22\\";\\"BuildingsAndLand_23\\";\\"InventoryAndEquipment_24\\";\\"OtherNonFinancialTangibleFixedAs_25\\";\\"FinancialFixedAssets_26\\";\\"TotalCurrentAssets_27\\";\\"Inventory_28\\";\\"Receivables_29\\";\\"ShortTermSecurities_30\\";\\"LiquidAssets_31\\";\\"TotalLiabilitiesAndEquity_32\\";\\"Equity_33\\";\\"Provisions_34\\";\\"LongTermDebt_35\\";\\"ShortTermDebt_36\\";\\"TotalInvestmentsGross_37\\";\\"InvestmentsGrossBuildingsAndLand_38\\";\\"InvestmentsGrossInventoryAndEq_39\\";\\"SolvencyRatio_40\\";\\"CurrentRatio_41\\";\\"ProfitMargin_42\\";\\"ResilienceRatio_43\\";\\"CapitalizationFactor_44\\""}	189	1	189	0	0.9705882352941176

How do certain characters contribute to the success or failure of a movie?\n\nThis dataset explores the box office data of Walt Disney Studios from 2000 to 2016. It includes information on the movie title, release date, main character, villain, and songs associated with each film. This dataset provides insights into how different elements contribute to a movie's success or failure\n\n### How to use the dataset\nWhen exploring this dataset, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, the data is divided into four different files: disney-characters.csv, disney_movies_total_gross.csv, disney-voice-actors.csv, and disney_revenue_1991-2016.csv. Each of these files contains information on different aspects of Disney's box office data.\n\nIn order to get the most out of this dataset, it is important to understand what each file contains and how the data is organized. For example, the file 'disney-characters.csv' includes information on the movie title, release date, main character, villain, and songs associated with each film. This data can be used to answer questions about how different elements contribute to a movie's success or failure\n\nTo make things easier, we've created a quick guide that outlines what you can find in each file:\n\n**disney-characters.csv:** This file contains information on the movie title, release date, main character, villain, and songs associated with each film\n**disney_movies_total_gross.csv:** This file includes data on the total gross of Walt Disney Studios movies from 2000 to 2016 \n**disney-voice-actors.csv:** This file contains information on the voice actors for Disney characters \n**disney_revenue_1991-2016:** This file contains data on the revenue of the Walt Disney Company from 1991 to 2016\n\n### Research Ideas\n1. Using the data to create predictive models that can suggest which film concepts are most likely to be successful\n2. Determining which factors are most important to moviegoers when deciding whether or not to see a particular film\n3. Finding similarities between films in Disney's back catalogue in order to make better decisions about what new films to produce\n\n\n\n### Columns\n\n\n\n_____\n\n**File: disney_revenue_1991-2016.csv**\n| Column name                         | Description                                                           |\n|:------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Year**                            | The year the movie was released.

As the world's largest coffeehouse chain, Starbucks is seen to be the major representation of the United States' second wave of coffee culture. As of September 2020, the company had 32,660 stores in 83 countries, including 16,637 company operated stores and 16,023 licensed stores. Of these 32,660 stores, 18,354 were in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Starbucks locations serve hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Depending on the country, most locations offer free Wi-Fi.\n\nHeadquartered in the Starbucks Center, the company was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle's Pike Place Market. During the early 1980s, they sold the company to Howard Schultz who – after a business trip to Milan, Italy – decided to make the coffee bean store a coffeeshop serving espresso-based drinks. While chief executive officer from 1986 to 2000, Schultz's first tenure led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the West Coast of the United States.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/kalilurrahman/starbucks-stock-data-live-and-latest	{finance,"time series analysis","deep learning","retail and shopping",investing}	{CC0-1.0}	{Date,Dividends,"Stock Splits",Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,zip,98134}	7574	13	59432	39	1

Politicians may have insider knowledge about policy that affects stock prices (In Virginia, this could pertain to large companies headquartered in the state like Altria, Northrop Grumman, and Dollar Tree) or the bills they push for may benefit corporations they own stock in.

Dates on the *weekend* (Saturday and Sunday), as well as *federal holidays*, are **excluded** from the debt tracker because the Treasury's fiscal data do not account for those days. Recent political debates in the US over the **potential raising of the debt ceiling** has inspired me to create this dataset. Personally, I believe that the issue will continue to dominate political discourse due to the **increasing polarization between Democrats and Republicans.**\n\n# Data Sources\n##### The primary data source used was the U.S. Treasury's official website, which publishes fiscal data pertaining to the American government. Considering the meticulous documentation of federal spending by the Treasury, no other authority is more equipped to provide insight on US debt.\n\n1. [U.S. Treasury's FiscalData Website](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny) - The United States Department of the Treasury published daily updates on the national debt since April 1st, 1993. However, intragovernmental holdings and total public debt outstanding have only been accounted for at the end of each fiscal year since 1997. Daily updates for those two statistics officially began since March 31st, 2005.\n2. [U.S. Treasury's Finance Guide to the National Debt](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/) - The United States Department of the Treasury released a detailed overview of the national debt and how it operates in conjunction with American society. The guide mainly provided essential contextual knowledge needed to create a meaningful dataset.\n\n# Statistics Being Tracked\n- Debt Held by the Public\n- Intragovernmental Holdings\t\n- Total Public

528	energy	BLE RSSI Dataset for Indoor localization	### Content\n\nThe dataset was created using the RSSI readings of an array of 13 ibeacons in the first floor of Waldo Library, Western Michigan University. Data was collected using iPhone 6S. The dataset contains two sub-datasets: a labeled dataset (1420 instances) and an unlabeled dataset (5191 instances). The recording was performed during the operational hours of the library. For the labeled dataset, the input data contains the location (label column), a timestamp, followed by RSSI readings of 13 iBeacons. RSSI measurements are negative values. Bigger RSSI values indicate closer proximity to a given iBeacon (e.g., RSSI of -65 represent a closer distance to a given iBeacon compared to RSSI of -85). For out-of-range iBeacons, the RSSI is indicated by -200. The locations related to RSSI readings are combined in one column consisting a letter for the column and a number for the row of the position. The following figure depicts the layout of the iBeacons as well as the arrange of locations. \n\n![iBeacons Layout](https://www.kaggle.com/mehdimka/ble-rssi-dataset/downloads/iBeacon_Layout.jpg)\n\n### Attribute Information\n\n - location: The location of receiving RSSIs from ibeacons b3001 to b3013; symbolic values showing the column and row of the location on the map (e.g., A01 stands for column A, row 1). \n - date: Datetime in the format of ‘d-m-yyyy hh:mm:ss’\n - b3001 - b3013: RSSI readings corresponding to the iBeacons; numeric, integers only.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nProvider:\nMehdi Mohammadi and Ala Al-Fuqaha, {mehdi.mohammadi, ala-alfuqaha}@wmich.edu,\nDepartment of Computer Science,\nWestern Michigan University\n\nCitation Request:\n\nM.

529	energy	Cause of Deaths around the World (Historical Data)	### Context\n\nA straightforward way to assess the health status of a population is to focus on mortality – or concepts like child mortality or life expectancy, which are based on mortality estimates. A focus on mortality, however, does not take into account that the burden of diseases is not only that they kill people, but that they cause suffering to people who live with them. Assessing health outcomes by both mortality and morbidity (the prevalent diseases) provides a more encompassing view on health outcomes. This is the topic of this entry. The sum of mortality and morbidity is referred to as the ‘burden of disease’ and can be measured by a metric called ‘Disability Adjusted Life Years‘ (DALYs). DALYs are measuring lost health and are a standardized metric that allow for direct comparisons of disease burdens of different diseases across countries, between different populations, and over time. Conceptually, one DALY is the equivalent of losing one year in good health because of either premature death or disease or disability. One DALY represents one lost year of healthy life. The first ‘Global Burden of Disease’ (GBD) was GBD 1990 and the DALY metric was prominently featured in the World Bank’s 1993 World Development Report. Today it is published by both the researchers at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and the ‘Disease Burden Unit’ at the World Health Organization (WHO), which was created in 1998. The IHME continues the work that was started in the early 1990s and publishes the Global Burden of Disease study.\n\n### Content\n\nIn this Dataset, we have Historical Data of different cause of deaths for all ages around the World.

530	energy	CO2 Emissions	The impact of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), on the earth's climate has become an increasingly important issue in recent years. CO2 emissions are produced by a variety of human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Understanding how much CO2 each country is emitting is crucial in developing effective climate policies and mitigating the effects of climate change.\n\nThe CO2 emissions dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the amount of CO2 emitted by each country. The dataset includes information on CO2 emissions by country from 1960 to the present day. It covers all countries in the world and is compiled from various sources, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nThe dataset can be used by researchers, policymakers, and the general public to gain insight into the relative contributions of different countries to global CO2 emissions. It can also be used to monitor changes in emissions over time and to assess the effectiveness of climate policies.\n\nOverall, the CO2 emissions dataset is an important resource for understanding the global climate challenge and for developing strategies to mitigate the impact of CO2 emissions on our planet.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/co2-emissions-by-country	{"atmospheric science",environment,beginner,intermediate,"data visualization","time series analysis"}	{"Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)"}	{country_code,country_name,year,value}	13953	4	55812	0	1
531	energy	CO2 Intensity of Electricity Generation	## Description\nElectricity generation gives rise to negative impacts on the environment and human health throughout all stages of its life-cycle. To date, power generation remains the largest GHG-emitting sector in Europe. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is by far the most commonly-emitted GHG across the sector, being a product of combustion processes. An almost complete decarbonisation of the EU’s electricity sector is needed in order to meet the EU’s objective of becoming the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. Electricity can play an increasing role in decarbonising energy use across a number of sectors, such as transport, industry and households. Information about the carbon intensity of electricity generation is therefore relevant for many stakeholders. The EEA and its European Topic Centre for Climate Change Mitigation and Energy (ETC/CME) produce each year country- and EU-level data on the average annual CO2 emission intensity of electricity generation.\n\nIdentifier\nDAT-232-en\nLanding Page\nhttps://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/co2-intensity-of-electricity-generation \n\n## Release Date\n2020-02-24\n\n## Modified Date\n2020-02-28\n\n## Geographical Coverage\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Belgium, Austria, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Germany, Czechia, Spain, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, United Kingdom, France, Hungary, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Malta, Latvia\n\n\n## Catalogue\nEuropean Union Open Data Portal\n\n\n## Reference\nURI\nhttp://data.europa.eu/88u/dataset/DAT-232-en	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/co2-intensity-of-electricity-generation	{europe,energy}	{"EU ODP Legal Notice"}	{CountryShort,CountryLong,Year,ValueNumeric,Unit,Data_source}	924	6	5544	0	1

So, where data from BP is available for a given country or year, we rely on it as the primary source. But we supplement this with data from Ember where it's not available.\n\n\n2020 electricity data is currently only available for EU countries and the UK based on the latest release of European data from Ember: https://ember-climate.org/data/european-electricity/\n\nOur World in Data has converted absolute electricity production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by the total electricity production.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/prateekmaj21/electricity-production-by-source-world	{energy,electricity}	{CC0-1.0}	{Entity,Code,Year,"Electricity from coal (TWh)","Electricity from gas (TWh)","Electricity from hydro (TWh)","Electricity from other renewables (TWh)","Electricity from solar (TWh)","Electricity from oil (TWh)","Electricity from wind (TWh)","Electricity from nuclear (TWh)"}	6241	11	68651	3862	0.8529411764705882

560	energy	Global Nuclear Energy Generation	Nuclear energy – alongside hydropower – is one of our oldest low-carbon energy technologies.\n\nNuclear power generation has been around since the 1960s but saw massive growth globally in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. In the interactive chart shown, we see how global nuclear generation has changed over the past half-century.\n\nFollowing fast growth during the 1970s to 1990s, the global generation has slowed significantly. In addition, we see a sharp dip in nuclear output following the Fukushima tsunami in Japan in 2011 as countries took plants offline due to safety concerns.\n\nBut we also see that in recent years, production has once again increased.\n\nThe global trend in nuclear energy generation masks the significant differences in its role at the country level.\n\nSome countries get no energy from nuclear – or are aiming to eliminate it – while others get the majority of their power from it.\n\nThis dataset shows the amount of nuclear energy generated by the country. France, the USA, China, Russia, and Canada all produce relatively large amounts of atomic power.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/jorgesandoval/global-nuclear-energy-generation	{research,"science and technology",energy,tabular,electricity}	{CC0-1.0}	{Entity,Code,Year,"Electricity from nuclear (TWh)"}	5474	4	21896	0	0.9117647058823529

549	energy	Environment Impact of Food Production	### Context\n\nAs the world’s population has expanded and gotten richer, the demand for food, energy and water has seen a rapid increase. Not only has demand for all three increased, but they are also strongly interlinked: food production requires water and energy; traditional energy production demands water resources; agriculture provides a potential energy source. This article focuses on the environmental impacts of food. Ensuring everyone in the world has access to a nutritious diet in a sustainable way is one of the greatest challenges we face.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains most 43 most common foods grown across the globe and 23 columns as their respective land, water usage and carbon footprints. \n\nColumns\n1. Land use change - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product \n2. Animal Feed - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n3. Farm   - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n4. Processing - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n5. Transport - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n6. Packaging - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n7. Retail - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n\nThese represent greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product) across different stages in the lifecycle of food production.\n\nEutrophication – the pollution of water bodies and ecosystems with excess nutrients – is a major environmental problem. The runoff of nitrogen and other nutrients from agricultural production systems is a leading contributor.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nhttps://ourworldindata.org\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\n1. Which types of food have more negative impact on the environment?\n2. What types of food production should be encouraged to consume nutritious diet in a sustainable way?\n3. Which stage of food production contributes more to the greenhouse gas emmision?\n4. Compare carbon footprint of plant-based foods?\n5. Compare carbon footprint of animal-based foods?\n6.

The records are accompanied by a country code, the nation’s name, and pricing information intertwined in Euros. \n> With this data, you will be able to track the evolution of energy prices between 2017-2021 - both in terms of residential households individuals as well as industrial entities alike. Gain insight into how different countries stack up against each other when it comes to where they source their electricity/gas from; ultimately gaining a clearer picture of Europe’s wide-reaching energy markets. Are some countries more resource dependent than others? What type of sector consumes more energy per capita? Unlock the answers to those questions with this rich dataset!\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides detailed price information on electricity and gas in the Euro Zone. It includes pricing information for both households and non-household sectors across multiple years. This data can be used to investigate market trends, compare prices between different countries, compare energy sources such as electricity versus gas, and make informed decisions about purchasing energy within the Euro Zone. \n> \n> To use this dataset, simply select the desired country by its country code or name from the columns ‘country’ or ‘country_name’. You will then be able to access all of the pricing records available for that particular country by year, with separate ones given for prices of electricity used by households, non-households sectors and also for gas used by households/non-households. You can create visuals such as graphs to track changing energy trends over time within a specific country or across multiple Euro zone nations at once if you so choose\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Analyzing the impact of an increased increase in energy costs over time on Euro Zone households, non-households, and industry sectors. By comparing electricity prices across different countries may be able to identify different trends on how energy costs are effecting the different regions differently and find ways to best optimize savings when it comes to electricity use. \n> - Estimating climate change impacts on Europe’s energy market by tracking potential changes in electricity and gas prices as a result of an altered environment or changing policy initiatives over time \n> - Identifying correlations between social economic factors and differences in electricity price that arise from varying policy implementations between regions in order to reduce the cost associated with accessing energy for vulnerable households or certain industrial sectors\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/6424152#.Y9Y7Y9JBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

Power stations are generally connected to an electrical grid.\n\nMany power stations contain one or more generators, a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into three-phase electric power. The relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electric current.\n\nThe energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to generate electricity. Clean energy sources include nuclear power, and increasing use of renewables such as solar, wind, wave, geothermal, and hydroelectric.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/global-powerplants	{business,finance,energy,investing,electricity}	{CC0-1.0}	{"country code",country_long,"name of powerplant","capacity in MW",latitude,longitude,primary_fuel,"secondary fuel",other_fuel2,other_fuel3,"start date","owner of plant",generation_gwh_2021,geolocation_source,estimated_generation_gwh_2021}	34936	15	524040	178565	1

557	energy	Global Energy Consumption & Renewable Generation	\n###Content \n\n4 of these datasets outline the quantity of terawatt hours (TWh) produced through various sources of energy, comparing both renewable and non-renewable sources, while highlighting the renewable use of the top 20 countries. The Renewables Power Generation dataset includes a 1997-2017 timeline that outlines the progress of the main renewable energy sectors : Hydro, Wind, Biofuel, Solar PV, and Geothermal. Additionally, the Top 20 Countries Power Generation dataset includes the national data for each of the renewable categories as outlined above. The last 2 datasets include the global TWh generated from renewable and non-renewable sources. \n\nIn the latest version, I added two datasets which contain the global consumption figures on national and continental/international group levels, which help provide context about the quantity of energy required, how that is changing over time, and how we are doing in terms of transitioning from non-renewable to renewable energy use. \n\n### Source\nRenewable Energy: Reddy, Vamsi., Kalananda, Aala., Komanapalli, Narayana.

559	energy	Global Energy Substitution from 1983 to 2022	The energy system has transformed dramatically since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nIt is based on historical estimates of primary energy consumption from Vaclav Smil, combined with updated figures from BP's [Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html).\n\nNote that this data presents primary energy consumption via the 'substitution method'. The 'substitution method' – in comparison to the 'direct method' – attempts to correct for the inefficiencies (energy wasted as heat during combustion) in fossil fuel and biomass conversion. It does this by correcting nuclear and modern renewable technologies to their 'primary input equivalents' if the same quantity of energy were to be produced from fossil fuels.\n\n\n### Collected by:\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado and Max Roser (2020) - "Energy Production and Consumption".

562	energy	Global Significant Earthquake Database from 2150BC	### Context\n\nThe Significant Earthquake Database is a global listing of over 5,700 earthquakes from 2150 BC to the present. \n\n\n### Content\nA significant earthquake is classified as one that meets at least one of the following criteria: caused deaths, caused moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami. The database provides information on the date and time of occurrence, latitude and longitude, focal depth, magnitude, maximum MMI intensity, and socio-economic data such as the total number of casualties, injuries, houses destroyed, and houses damaged, and $ dollage damage estimates. References, political geography, and additional comments are also provided for each earthquake. If the earthquake was associated with a tsunami or volcanic eruption, it is flagged and linked to the related tsunami event or significant volcanic eruption. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nhttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/global-significant-earthquake-database-2150-bc-to-present\n\n\n\n10 = \tCentral, Western and S.

The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.\n\n\n\nMw Magnitude:\nValid values: 0.0 to 9.9\n\nThe Mw magnitude is based on the moment magnitude scale. Moment is a physical quantity proportional to the slip on the fault times the area of the fault surface that slips; it is related to the total energy released in the EQ. The moment can be estimated from seismograms (and also from geodetic measurements). The moment is then converted into a number similar to other earthquake magnitudes by a standard formula. The result is called the moment magnitude. The moment magnitude provides an estimate of earthquake size that is valid over the complete range of magnitudes, a characteristic that was lacking in other magnitude scales.\n\nThe magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.\n\n\n\nmb Magnitude:\nValid values: 0.0 to 9.9\n\nThe Mb magnitude is the compressional body wave (P-wave) magnitude.\n\nThe magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.\n\nBar Chart of distribution \n\n\n\nML Magnitude:\nValid values: 0.0 to 9.9\n\nThe ML magnitude was the original magnitude relationship defined by Richter and Gutenberg for local earthquakes in 1935. It is based on the maximum amplitude of a seismogram recorded on a Wood-Anderson torsion seismograph. Although these instruments are no longer widely in use, ML values are calculated using modern instrumentation with appropriate adjustments.\n\nThe magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.\n\nBar Chart of distribution \n\n\nMfa Magnitude:\nValid values: 0.0 to 9.9\n\nThe Mfa magnitudes are computed from the felt area, for earthquakes that occurred before seismic instruments were in general use.\n\nThe magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.\n\nBar Chart of distribution \n\n\nUnknown Magnitude:\nValid values: 0.0 to 9.9\n\nThe computational method for the earthquake magnitude was unknown and could not be determined from the published sources.\n\nThe magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about 1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs.\n\nBar Chart of distribution \n\n\n\nMMI Intensity:\nValid values: 1 to 12\n\nThe Modified Mercalli Intensity (Int) is given in Roman Numerals (converted to numbers in the digital database). An interpretation of the values is listed below.\n\nTable 1.--Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale of 1931\nI. \tNot felt except by a very few under especially favorable circumstances.\nII. \tFelt only by a few persons at rest, especially on upper floors of buildings.

574	energy	Perovskite Stability	### Context\n\nThis Dataset for perovskite stability gives energies of compositions of potential perovskite materials relative to the convex hull calculated with DFT. The perovskite dataset also includes columns with information about the A site, B site, and X site in the perovskite structure in order to perform more advanced grouping of the data.\n\n### Content\n\nRelevant papers:\n\t\tOriginal paper with more dataset details and ML results [4]:\n\t\thttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092702561830274X\n\t\t\n\tX features:\n\t\tThe perovskite stability dataset includes columns giving detailed information about\n\t\tthe materials composition and structure. An overall composition is given, and then\n\t\tthat composition is broken down by which elements occupy each site within the\n\t\tperovskite structure. These columns were used to generate columns 12 and onward.\n\t\tThe composition information in combination with the MAGPIE approach for\n\t\tgenerating elemental descriptors was used to generate these columns [3].\n\t\tFor example, the "First Ionization Potential (V)_AB_avg" column gives the average\n\t\tvalue for atoms at the A and B sites in the perovskite structure.\n\t\t\n\tY property:\n\t\tThe perovskite Stability dataset includes the "energy_above_hull (meV/atom)"\n\t\tcolumn as the property to be predicted. The energy above the convex hull gives\n\t\tan approximation for how stable each composition will be, and thus how easy\n\t\tthe material may be to synthesize experimentally.\n\n\t\tA second property to predict is included in the “formation_energy (eV/atom)” column.\n\t\tThe formation energy given is the DFT energy of the perovskite structure relative to the\n\t\tDFT energy of the appropriate concentrations of elemental end-members in their stable state.\n\t\tThis property is not a direct measure of stability, but can still be an interesting property\n\t\tto predict.\n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMorgan, Dane (2018): Machine Learning Materials Datasets. figshare.

575	energy	Power consumption in India(2019-2020)	### Context\n\nIndia is the world's third-largest producer and third-largest consumer of electricity. The national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 370.106 GW as of 31 March 2020. Renewable power plants, which also include large hydroelectric plants, constitute 35.86% of India's total installed capacity. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the gross electricity generated by utilities in India was 1,372 TWh and the total electricity generation (utilities and non-utilities) in the country was 1,547 TWh. The gross electricity consumption in 2018-19 was 1,181 kWh per capita. \nIn 2015-16, electric energy consumption in agriculture was recorded as being the highest (17.89%) worldwide. The per capita electricity consumption is low compared to most other countries despite India having a low electricity tariff.\n\nIn light of the recent COVID-19 situation, when everyone has been under lockdown for the months of April & May the impacts of the lockdown on economic activities have been faced by every sector in a positive or a negative way. \nWith the electricity consumption being so crucial to the country, we came up with a plan to study the impact on energy consumption state and region wise.\n\nThe dataset is exhaustive in its demonstration of energy consumption state wise.\n\n### Content\nData is in the form of a time series for a period of 17 months beginning from 2nd Jan 2019 till 23rd May 2020. \nRows are indexed with dates and columns represent states. \nRows and columns put together, each datapoint reflects the power consumed in Mega Units (MU) by the given state (column) at the given date (row).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nPower System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) is a wholly-owned Government of India enterprise under the Ministry of Power. It was earlier a wholly-owned subsidiary of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. It was formed in March 2009 to handle the power management functions of PGCIL.\n\nThe dataset has been scraped from the weekly energy reports of POSOCO.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nExtensive research on power usage in the country is what inspired us to compile the dataset. We are making it public along with our research of the same. This is our first step towards independent data-based research. We are open to suggestions, compliments and criticism alike. \n\n### Do leave an upvote if you found the dataset helpful.

576	energy	Power Plant Data	About the dataset\nThe data points were collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011) when the power plant was set to work with a full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables - Ambient Temperature (AT), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant.\n\nA combined-cycle power plant uses both gas and a steam turbine together to produce up to 50 percent more electricity from the same fuel than a traditional simple-cycle plant. The waste heat from the gas turbine is routed to the nearby steam turbine, which generates extra power.\n\nAll the UN Member States have to submit a report on the combined cycle power plant to the United Nations. The Power Plant officials of Mexico are devising a way to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant. You are appointed as the chief for this operation.

The dataset includes information on hydropower, wind, solar, biofuel, and geothermal energy production from around the world.\n\nSince the Industrial Revolution, the energy mix of most countries across the world has become dominated by fossil fuels. This has major implications for the global climate, as well as for human health. \nTo reduce CO2 emissions and local air pollution, the world needs to rapidly shift towards low-carbon sources of energy – nuclear and renewable technologies.\n`Renewable energy will play a key role in the decarbonization of our energy systems in the coming decades. But how rapidly is our production of renewable energy changing?

581	energy	Renewable Energy (1960-2023)	Renewable energy is defined as the contribution of renewables to total primary energy supply (TPES). Renewables include the primary energy equivalent of hydro (excluding pumped storage), geothermal, solar, wind, tide and wave sources. Energy derived from solid biofuels, biogasoline, biodiesels, other liquid biofuels, biogases and the renewable fraction of municipal waste are also included. Biofuels are defined as fuels derived directly or indirectly from biomass (material obtained from living or recently living organisms). This includes wood, vegetal waste (including wood waste and crops used for energy production), ethanol, animal materials/wastes and sulphite lyes. Municipal waste comprises wastes produced by the residential, commercial and public service sectors that are collected by local authorities for disposal in a central location for the production of heat and/or power. This indicator is measured in thousand toe (tonne of oil equivalent) as well as in percentage of total primary energy supply.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/renewable-energy-1960-2023	{energy,"renewable energy"}	{other}	{"ï»¿\\"LOCATION\\"",INDICATOR,SUBJECT,MEASURE,FREQUENCY,TIME,Value,"Flag Codes"}	15904	8	127232	15904	1

591	energy	Solar energy power generation dataset	Solar-based energy is becoming one of the most promising sources for producing power for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Energy production based on solar photovoltaic (PV) systems has gained much attention from researchers and practitioners recently due to its desirable characteristics. However, the main difficulty in solar energy production is the volatility intermittent of photovoltaic system power generation, which is mainly due to weather conditions. For the large-scale solar farms, the power imbalance of the photovoltaic system may cause a significant loss in their economical profit. Accurate forecasting of the power output of PV systems in a short term is of great importance for daily/hourly efficient management of power grid production, delivery, and storage, as well as for decision-making on the energy market, facilitate early participation in energy auction markets and efficient resource planning.\n\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/stucom/solar-energy-power-generation-dataset	{"earth science",environment,"science and technology",energy,"renewable energy"}	{"Community Data License Agreement - Sharing - Version 1.0"}	{temperature_2_m_above_gnd,relative_humidity_2_m_above_gnd,mean_sea_level_pressure_MSL,total_precipitation_sfc,snowfall_amount_sfc,total_cloud_cover_sfc,high_cloud_cover_high_cld_lay,medium_cloud_cover_mid_cld_lay,low_cloud_cover_low_cld_lay,shortwave_radiation_backwards_sfc,wind_speed_10_m_above_gnd,wind_direction_10_m_above_gnd,wind_speed_80_m_above_gnd,wind_direction_80_m_above_gnd,wind_speed_900_mb,wind_direction_900_mb,wind_gust_10_m_above_gnd,angle_of_incidence,zenith,azimuth,generated_power_kw}	4213	21	88473	0	0.7647058823529411

592	energy	Solar Powe Generation Data	\nSolar energy generation is one of fastest growing and most promising renewable energy sources of power generation worldwide. Nowadays, the electrical energy becomes one of the basic needs in our daily life, which makes increasing demand for it.\nAs a major source of electrical power generation fossil fuels are depleting day by day and also its usage raises serious environmental concerns. These reasons force the development of new energy sources which are renewable and ecologically safe.\nThere are several applications that use solar power, here is the information on the generation of electricity through PV cells. The solar power generation is the most efficient route for power generation because it takes a minimum number of steps (for producing electricity) than that of other generation methods.\nPV solar cells are interconnected to form a PV module to capture the sun rays and convert solar energy into electricity. So when the PV modules are exposed to sunlight, they generate direct current. It is one of the best ways in nowadays which can transfer the solar energy into utilization. Many countries in the world have taken this technique into utilization; however, the estimation of the PV generation is a challenge because the PV system generation is greatly affected by the weather conditions.\n\n\nAs the weather has great influence on the production of PV systems, such as irradiation, temperature, humidity, wind velocity. The goal of this competition is to build the relationship between the weather with the production of PV systems by analyzing history data. Through the model, we are able to use predicted data of weather in the near future to predict the production of PV systems. Once the result deviate much from\nprediction, probably there are problems with PV system, and the reason need to be figured out, and then adopt proper measure to fix the PV system and make better decisions. For example, according to the accurate forecast, PV system operators can balance the consumption of power and reserve spared power for emergency.\n\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/pythonafroz/solar-powe-generation-data	{"renewable energy"}	{unknown}	{Date-Hour(NMT),WindSpeed,Sunshine,AirPressure,Radiation,AirTemperature,RelativeAirHumidity,SystemProduction}	8760	8	70080	0	0.6470588235294118
593	energy	Solar Power Energy by Country	**# Solar Power Energy by Country**\n\nMany countries and territories have installed significant solar power capacity into their electrical grids to supplement or provide an alternative to conventional energy sources. Solar power plants use one of two technologies:\n\n- Photovoltaic (PV) systems use solar panels, either on rooftops or in ground-mounted solar farms, converting sunlight directly into electric power.\n- Concentrated solar power (CSP, also known as "concentrated solar thermal") plants use solar thermal energy to make steam, that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine.\n\n- Worldwide growth of photovoltaics is extremely dynamic and varies strongly by country. By the end of 2019, a cumulative amount of 629 GW of solar power was installed throughout the world.[3] By early 2020, the leading country for solar power was China with 208 .Accounting for one-third of global installed solar capacity. As of 2020, there are at least 37 countries around the world with a cumulative PV capacity of more than one gigawatt.\n\n- The top installers of 2016 through 2019 were China, the United States, and India.[6][7] The available solar PV capacity in Honduras is now sufficient to supply 12.5% of the nation's electrical energy while Australia is approaching 11%. Italy, Germany and Greece can produce between 7% and 8% of their respective annual domestic electricity consumption. Germany, situated in a region with only 1000 kWh per kWp solar potential, has produced up to 40 GW of power during peak hours on 27 April 2021 more than 60% of the necessary 65 GW.\n\n- After an almost two decade long hiatus, deployment of CSP resumed in 2007. However, the design for several new projects is being changed to cheaper photovoltaics.[ Most operational CSP stations are located in Spain and the United States, while large solar farms using photovoltaics are being constructed in an expanding list of geographic regions.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/solar-power-energy-by-country	{energy,"renewable energy","data analytics",electricity,forcats}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Unnamed: 0","Unnamed: 0_level_0",2016,"Unnamed: 3",2017,"Unnamed: 5",2018,"Unnamed: 7",2019,"Unnamed: 9",2020,"Unnamed: 11",2021,"Unnamed: 13",2019.1,2021.1,"Share of totalconsumption"}	93	17	1581	449	0.9411764705882353

609	energy	Texas Wind Turbine Dataset - Simulated	\n## Problem Statement:\nThe intermittent nature and low control over the wind conditions bring up the same problem to every grid operator in their successful integration to satisfy current demand. In combination with having to predict demand and balance it with the supply, the grid operator now also must predict the availability of wind and solar generation plants in the next hour, day, or week. Apart from holding\nback the benefits of renewable energy, incorrectly scheduling of wind generation plants may lead to unnecessary reservations, higher costs passed over to the consumer, and use of other more expensive and polluting power resources.\nWorking with real data is challenging due to noise and missing periods. \n\n## Dataset details\nThe provided full-year hourly time-series are simulated using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) software for a location in Texas, US.

597	energy	Spotify Recommendation	# Spotify Recommandation\n\n( You can check how I used this dataset on [my github repository](https://github.com/Brice-Vergnou/spotify_recommandation) )\n\nI am basically a HUGE fan of music ( mostly French rap though with some exceptions but I love music ). And someday , while browsing stuff on Internet , I found the [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) . I knew I had to use it when I found out you could get information like danceability about your favorite songs just with their id's.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86613710/127216769-745ac143-7456-4464-bbe3-adc53872c133.png)\n\nOnce I saw that , my machine learning instincts forced me to work on this project.\n\n## 1. Data Collection\n\n### 1.1 Playlist creation\nI collected 100 liked songs and 95 disliked songs\n\nFor those I like , I made a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2WONKi3eZaR29QaQCRSiAE?si=a2463f1d382f4399) of my favorite 100 songs. It is mainly French Rap , sometimes American rap , rock or electro music.\n\nFor those I dislike , I collected songs from various kind of music so the model will have a broader view of what I don't like\n\nThere is :\n- [25 metal songs ( Cannibal Corps )](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO0grpKg?si=3c829a46465d4367)\n- [20 " I don't like " rap songs ( PNL )](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX2fxPY4lXxv8?si=c69f40a2a2014a25)\n- [25 classical songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1h0CEZCm6IbFTbxThn6Xcs?si=933db0752a684db0)\n- [25 Disco songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2rkU3Aop33atDJoF8LCCjh?si=5e1247ee29284f0a)\n\nI didn't include any Pop song because I'm kinda neutral about it\n\n### 1.2 Getting the ID's\n\n1. From the [Spotify's API "Get a playlist's Items"](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlist-tracks/) , I turned the playlists into json formatted data which cointains the ID and the name of each track ( ids/yes.py and ids/no.py ). NB : on the website , specify "items(track(id,name))" in the fields format , to avoid being overwhelmed by useless data.\n\n2. With a script ( ids/ids_to_data.py ) , I turned the json data into a long string with each ID separated with a comma.\n\n### 1.3 Getting the statistics\n\nNow I just had to enter the strings into the [Spotify API "Get Audio Features from several tracks"](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-audio-features-several-tracks/) and get my data files ( data/good.json and data/dislike.json )\n\n## 2. Data features\n\nFrom [Spotify's API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#object-audiofeaturesobject) :\n\n* **acousticness** : A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\n* **danceability** : Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n* **duration_ms** : The duration of the track in milliseconds.\n* **energy** : Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\n* **instrumentalness** : Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\n* **key** : The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.\n* **liveness** : Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n* **loudness** : The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\n* **mode** : Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n* **speechiness** : Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\n* **tempo** : The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n* **time_signature** : An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).\n* **valence** : A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\n\nAnd the variable that has to be predicted :\n\n* **liked** : 1 for liked songs , 0 for disliked songs\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/bricevergnou/spotify-recommendation	{music,"earth and nature","computer science",programming,beginner,intermediate,classification,tabular}	{CC0-1.0}	{danceability,energy,key,loudness,mode,speechiness,acousticness,instrumentalness,liveness,valence,tempo,duration_ms,time_signature,liked}	195	14	2730	0	1

Sometimes these goods are produced in our own country – and so that energy is reported in our country’s energy use data. But when we buy goods from overseas, this energy is included in their accounts. It’s missing from ours.1\n\nWhen we compare energy use across the world we rarely adjust for the energy embedded in imports. But what happens when we do?

Additionally, renewable energy\n\n- improves public health\n- creates jobs\n- ensures energy security through diversification\n- stabilises energy prices\n\nThe importance of moving away from fossil fuels and towards renewable sources cannot be understated. As such, this dataset tracks the growth of the UK's renewable sector from 1990 to 2020.\n\n#Content\n\nThis dataset details the consumption of energy from 17 different renewable and waste sources from 1990 to 2020. It contains the energy use from each source individually as well as the total consumption. It also contains the total energy consumption from primary fuels and therefore the very useful metric: % of consumption from renewables!\n\nUnits: The unit of energy used in this dataset is the [megatonne of oil equivalent (mtoe)](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Tonne_of_oil_equivalent#:~:text=on%20the%20toe-,Mtoe,a%20tremendous%20amount%20of%20energy.) . For context 1 mtoe = 42 petajoules (42 x 10^15 J)\n\n#Dataset Notes\n\n- Wind includes wave and tidal from 2000\n- Cross-boundary adjustment includes use by UK residents abroad and excludes by foreign residents in UK territory. It applies to bioethanol and biodiesel.\n- All figures are reported to 3 decimal places. Total figures are based on raw data and therefore may not sum due to rounding. \n\n#Acknowledgements\n\nThis data is from Ricardo Energy and Environment, [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) and was downloaded from [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsenergyconsumptionfromrenewableandwastesources) on 9 October 2022.\n\nThe dataset's release date was 9 June 2022.\n\nThe dataset is licensed under the [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) according to [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2001censusandearlier/dataandproducts/copyrightandlicensing/licenseinformation).\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/magnussesodia/uk-renewable-energy-production	{"renewable energy",tabular}	{other}	{ï»¿Year,"Energy from renewable & waste sources","Total energy consumption of primary fuels and equivalents","Fraction from renewable sources and waste","Hydroelectric power","Wind, wave, tidal","Solar photovoltaic","Geothermal aquifers","Landfill gas","Sewage gas","Biogas from autogen","Municipal solid waste (MSW)","Poultry litter",Straw,Wood,Charcoal,"Liquid bio-fuels",Bioethanol,Biodiesel,Biomass,"Cross-boundary Adjustment"}	31	21	651	0	1

The balance of a net exporter appears as a negative value (-). The balance of geographic and geopolitical zones is simply the sum of the trade balance of all countries.\n\n- CO2 emissions from fuel combustion: CO2 emissions cover only the emissions from fossil fuel combustion (coal, oil and gas). They are calculated according to the UNFCCC methodology. Here the reference approach is presented, ie the sum of CO2 emissions of each energy.\n\n- CO2 intensity: CO2 intensity is the ratio of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion over Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measured in constant US $ at purchasing power parities. It measures the CO2 emitted to generate one unit of GDP. GDP is expressed at constant exchange rate and purchasing power parity to remove the impact of inflation and reflect differences in general price levels and relate energy consumption to the real level of economic activity. Using purchasing power parity rates for GDP instead of exchange rates increases the value of GDP in regions with a low cost of living, and therefore decreases their energy intensities.\n\n- Crude oil: Crude oil includes all liquid hydrocarbons to be refined: crude oil, liquids from natural gas (NGL), and semi-refined products.\n\n- Crude oil, coal and lignite production : corresponds to gross production.\n\n- Electricity production: Electricity production corresponds to gross production. It includes public production (production of private and public electricity utilities) and industrial producers for their own uses, by any type of power plant (including cogeneration).\n\n- Energy intensity of GDP at constant purchasing power parities: The energy intensity is the ratio of primary energy consumption over Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measured in constant US $ at purchasing power parities. It measures the total amount of energy necessary to generate one unit of GDP. GDP is expressed at constant exchange rate and purchasing power parity to remove the impact of inflation and reflect differences in general price levels and relate energy consumption to the real level of economic activity. Using purchasing power parity rates for GDP instead of exchange rates increases the value of GDP in regions with a low cost of living, and therefore decreases their energy intensities.\n\n- Natural gas production: Natural gas production corresponds to the marketed production (i.e. excluding quantities flared or reinjected).\n\n- NGL : Natural Gas Liquids\n\n- Oil products: Oil products are all liquid hydrocarbons, obtained by the refining of crude oil and NGL and by treatment of natural gas, in particular, LPG production (Liquid Petroleum Gas) includes LPG from natural gas separation plants. Ethanol used as motor fuel in Brazil as well as fuels derived from coal in South Africa are not included in oil products.\n\n- Share of renewables in electricity production: Ratio between the electricity production from renewables (hydro, wind, geothermal and solar) and the total electricity production.\n\n- Share of wind and solar in electricity production: Electricity produced from wind and solar energy divided by the total electricity production.\n\n- Share of electricity in total final energy consumption: Final electricity demand divided by the total final energy consumption. \n\n- Total primary production: Primary production evaluates the quantity of natural energy resources ("primary energy sources") extracted or produced. For natural gas, the quantities flared or reinjected are excluded. Production of hydro, geothermal, nuclear and wind electricity is considered as primary production.\n\n- Total energy consumption: The total energy consumption is the balance of primary production, external trade, marine bunkers and stock changes. The total energy consumption includes biomass.For the world, marine bunkers are included. This induces a gap with the sum of regions.\n\n- Average CO2 emission factor: The average CO2 emission factor (carbon factor) is calculated doing the ratio between emissions over primary energy consumption.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/shub218/energy-data-1990-2020	{energy}	{world-bank}	{ï»¿country,Year,Region,"CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (MtCO2)","Average CO2 emission factor (tCO2/toe)","CO2 intensity at constant purchasing power parities (kCO2/$15p)","Total energy production (Mtoe)","Total energy consumption (Mtoe)","Share of renewables in electricity production (%)","Share of electricity in total final energy consumption (%)","Oil products domestic consumption (Mt)","Refined oil products production (Mt)","Natural gas production (bcm)","Natural gas domestic consumption (bcm)","Energy intensity of GDP at constant purchasing power parities (koe/$15p)","Electricity production (TWh)","Electricity domestic consumption (TWh)","Coal and lignite domestic consumption (Mt)","Share of wind and solar in electricity production (%)","Crude oil production (Mt)","Coal and lignite production (Mt)"}	1364	21	28644	0	0.8235294117647058

621	energy	World Per Capita Energy Consumption	There are large inequalities in energy consumption between countries. The average US citizen still consumes more than ten times the energy of the average Indian, 4-5 times that of a Brazilian, and three times more than China. The gulf between these and very low-income nations is even greater- a number of low-income nations consume less than 100 kilowatt-hour equivalents per person.\n\nSecondly, global average per capita energy consumption has been consistently increasing; between 1970 and 2014, average consumption increased by approximately 45%.\n\nThis growth in per capita energy consumption does, however, vary significantly between countries and regions. Most of the growth in per capita energy consumption over the last few decades has been driven by increased consumption in transitioning middle-income (and to a lesser extent, low income countries). In the chart we see a significant increase in consumption in transitioning BRICS economies (China, India and Brazil in particular); China’s per capita use has grown by nearly 250 percent since 2000; India by more than 50 percent; and Brazil by 38 percent.\n\nWhilst global energy growth is growing from developing economies, the trend for many high-income nations is a notable decline. As we see in exemplar trends from the UK and US, the growth we are currently seeing in transitioning economies ended for many high-income nations by over the 1970s and 80s. Both the US and UK peaked in terms of per capita energy consumption in the 1970s, plateauing for several decades until the early 2000s. Since then, we see a reduction in consumption; since 2000, UK usage has decreased by 20 to 25%.\n\n### Source\nHannah Ritchie (2019) - "Access to Energy".

624	politics	BMW Pricing Challenge	### Context\n\nEstimating the value of a used car is one of the main everyday challenges in automotive business. We believe that the sales price of a car is not only based on the value of the product itself, but is also heavily influenced by things like market trends, current availability and politics.\nWith this challenge we hope to raise some interest in this exciting topic and also gain some insight in what the main factors are that drive the value of a used car.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data provided consists of almost 5000 real BMW cars that were sold via a b2b auction in 2018. The price shown in the table is the highest bid that was reached during the auction.\n\nWe have already done some data cleanup and filtered out cars with engine damage etc. However there may still be minor damages like scratches, but we do not have more information about that.\n\nWe have also extracted 8 criteria based on the equipment of car that we think might have a good impact on the value of a used car. These criteria have been labeled feature_1 to feature_8 and are shown in the data below.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWe would like to find a good statistical model to describe the value of a used car depending on the basic description and the 8 provided features. The following questions are of special interest to us:\n\n1. How much impact does each of features have on the estimate value of the car?\n\n2. How does the estimated value of a car change over time? Can you detect any patterns? (e.g. the price of a convertible should be higher in summer than in winter)\n\n3. How big is the influence of the factors not represented in the data on the price?

After looking at the data available this became: Degree, non born in the UK, %white population, and salary.

630	politics	2017 Conservative Party of Canada Leadership	On 27 May 2017, the Conservative Party of Canada elected a new party leader. As the party with the second-most seats in the Parliament, the new leader will become the official Leader of the Opposition. \n\nThe party rules dictate that each electoral district (riding) is equally represented in the leadership election, regardless of the number of members in the riding, although leadership contenders endeavour to sign up new members in order to increase their vote proportion in the riding. The election is an instant runoff vote, with members completing their preferences on the ballot paper. If no candidate achieves a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes distributed to remaining candidates, based on the preferences of the voters. Fourteen candidates registered for the leadership ballot and engaged in debates in both official languages. \n\nThe Member for Regina—Qu'Appelle in Saskatchewan, Andrew Scheer MP, won the leadership on the thirteenth ballot with 50.95% of the vote, compared to Maxime Bernier MP, with 49.05% of the vote. \n\nThis dataset details the percentage of the vote received by each candidate in each round, by province and by riding. The results were taken from the Conservative Party of Canada website: https://www.intvoting.com/cpcresults/index.html?lang=en#results \n\nIt may be interesting to explore which candidates attracted the most preferences as other candidates were excluded and which were more polarising figures. It may also be interesting to see which candidates performed strongest in Conservative-held ridings, and which candidates performed best in competitive ridings. Perhaps a relationship exists between support for a party at the 2015 election and support for a candidate in the leadership.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/smid80/2017conservativepartycanadaleadership	{politics}	{CC0-1.0}	{Province,"Candidate name",Round,Percent,Riding}	36492	9	181108	0	1
631	politics	Correlates of War: World Religions	# Content\n\nThe World Religion Project aims to provide detailed information about religious adherence worldwide since 1945. It contains data about the number of adherents by religion in each of the states in the international system for every half-decade period. Some of the religions are divided into religious families, and the breakdown of adherents within a given religion into religious families is provided to the extent data are available.\n\nThe project was developed in three stages. The first stage consisted of the formation of a religions tree. A religion tree is a systematic classification of major religions and of religious families within those major religions. To develop the religion tree we prepared a comprehensive literature review, the aim of which was to define a religion, to find tangible indicators of a given religion of religious families within a major religion, and to identify existing efforts at classifying world religions. The second stage consisted of the identification of major data sources of religious adherence and the collection of data from these sources according to the religion tree classification. This created a dataset that included multiple records for some states for a given point in time, yet contained multiple missing data for specific states, specific time periods, and specific religions. The third stage consisted of cleaning the data, reconciling discrepancies of information from different sources, and imputing data for the missing cases.\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe dataset was created by Zeev Maoz, University of California-Davis, and Errol Henderson, Pennsylvania State University, and published by the Correlates of War Project.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/umichigan/world-religions	{"religion and belief systems",politics}	{unknown}	{year,christianity_protestant,christianity_romancatholic,christianity_easternorthodox,christianity_anglican,christianity_other,christianity_all,judaism_orthodox,judaism_conservative,judaism_reform,judaism_other,judaism_all,islam_sunni,islam_shiâa,islam_ibadhi,islam_nationofislam,islam_alawite,islam_ahmadiyya,islam_other,islam_all,buddhism_mahayana,buddhism_theravada,buddhism_other,buddhism_all,zoroastrianism_all,hinduism_all,sikhism_all,shinto_all,bahaâi_all,taoism_all,jainism_all,confucianism_all,syncretism_all,animism_all,noreligion_all,otherreligion_all,religion_all,population,world_population,protestant_percent,romancatholic_percent,easternorthodox_percent,anglican_percent,otherchristianity_percent,christianity_percent,orthodox_percent,conservative_percent,reform_percent,otherjudaism_percent,judaism_percent,sunni_percent,shiâa_percent,ibadhi_percent,nationofislam_percent,alawite_percent,ahmadiyya_percent,otherislam_percent,islam_percent,mahayana_percent,theravada_percent,otherbuddhism_percent,buddhism_percent,zoroastrianism_percent,hinduism_percent,sikhism_percent,shinto_percent,bahaâi_percent,taoism_percent,jainism_percent,confucianism_percent,syncretism_percent,animism_percent,noreligion_percent,otherreligion_percent,religion_sumpercent,total_percent,state,code,dual_religion,source_code,region,worldpopulation_percent}	2079	233	164129	5	0.7058823529411765
632	politics	Corruption Perceptions Index	# Content\n\nThe Corruption Perceptions Index scores and ranks countries/territories based on how corrupt a country’s public sector is perceived to be. It is a composite index, a combination of surveys and assessments of corruption, collected by a variety of reputable institutions. The CPI is the most widely used indicator of corruption worldwide.\n\nCorruption generally comprises illegal activities, which are deliberately hidden and only come to light through scandals, investigations or prosecutions. There is no meaningful way to assess absolute levels of corruption in countries or territories on the basis of hard empirical data. Possible attempts to do so, such as by comparing bribes reported, the number of prosecutions brought or studying court cases directly linked to corruption, cannot be taken as definitive indicators of corruption levels.

639	politics	Dutch politics: the childcare benefits scandal	From Wikipedia:\n\nThe Dutch childcare benefits scandal (Dutch: kinderopvangtoeslagaffaire or toeslagenaffaire, lit. '[childcare] benefits affair') is a political scandal in the Netherlands concerning false allegations of fraud made by the Tax and Customs Administration while attempting to regulate the distribution of childcare benefits. Between 2013 and 2019, authorities wrongly accused an estimated 26,000 parents of making fraudulent benefit claims, requiring them to pay back the allowances they had received in their entirety. In many cases, this sum amounted to tens of thousands of euros, driving families into severe financial hardship.\n\nThe scandal was brought to public attention in September 2018. Investigators have subsequently described the working procedure of the Tax and Customs Administration as "discriminatory" and filled with "institutional bias". On 15 January 2021, two months before the 2021 general election, the third Rutte cabinet resigned over the scandal following a parliamentary inquiry into the matter, which concluded that "fundamental principles of the rule of law" had been violated.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal\n\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/dutch-politics-the-childcare-benefits-scandal	{politics}	{CC0-1.0}	{user_name,user_location,user_followers,user_friends,user_verified,date,text,hashtags,source,language,is_retweet}	8088	11	88968	5951	0.7647058823529411
640	politics	Economic Freedom of the World	### Introduction\n\nThe index published in [*Economic Freedom of the World*][1] by the [Fraser Institute][2] measures the degree to which the policies and institutions of countries are supportive of economic freedom. The cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to enter markets and compete, and security of the person and privately owned property. Forty-two data points are used to construct a summary index and to measure the degree of economic freedom in five broad areas.\n\n\n### Areas\n\n - **Area 1: Size of Government** - As government spending, taxation, and\n   the size of government-controlled enterprises increase, government\n   decision-making is substituted for individual choice and economic\n   freedom is reduced.\n - **Area 2: Legal System and Property Rights** - Protection of persons and\n   their rightfully acquired property is a central element of both\n   economic freedom and civil society. Indeed, it is the most important\n   function of government.\n - **Area 3: Sound Money** - Inflation erodes the value of rightfully earned\n   wages and savings. Sound money is thus essential to protect property\n   rights. When inflation is not only high but also volatile, it becomes\n   difficult for individuals to plan for the future and thus use\n   economic freedom effectively.\n - **Area 4: Freedom to Trade Internationally** - Freedom to exchange—in its\n   broadest sense, buying, selling, making contracts, and so on—is\n   essential to economic freedom, which is reduced when freedom to\n   exchange does not include businesses and individuals in other\n   nations.\n - **Area 5: Regulation** - Governments not only use a number of tools to\n   limit the right to exchange internationally, they may also develop\n   onerous regulations that limit the right to exchange, gain credit,\n   hire or work for whom you wish, or freely operate your business.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom\n  [2]: https://www.fraserinstitute.org/	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/gsutters/economic-freedom	{global,government,politics,economics,"international relations"}	{unknown}	{year,ISO_code,countries,"ECONOMIC FREEDOM",rank,quartile,1a_government_consumption,1b_transfers,1c_gov_enterprises,1d_top_marg_tax_rate,1_size_government,2a_judicial_independence,2b_impartial_courts,2c_protection_property_rights,2d_military_interference,2e_integrity_legal_system,2f_legal_enforcement_contracts,2g_restrictions_sale_real_property,2h_reliability_police,2i_business_costs_crime,2j_gender_adjustment,2_property_rights,3a_money_growth,3b_std_inflation,3c_inflation,3d_freedom_own_foreign_currency,3_sound_money,4a_tariffs,4b_regulatory_trade_barriers,4c_black_market,4d_control_movement_capital_ppl,4_trade,5a_credit_market_reg,5b_labor_market_reg,5c_business_reg,5_regulation}	3726	36	134136	30892	0.7352941176470589

These standards have been endorsed in a series of authoritative conventions, treaties, protocols, and guidelines by agencies of the international community and apply universally to all countries throughout the electoral cycle, including during the pre-electoral period, the campaign, on polling day, and in its aftermath.\n\n\n# Content\n\nThe Perceptions of Electoral Integrity (PEI) survey asks experts to evaluate elections according to [49 indicators][1], grouped into eleven categories reflecting the whole electoral cycle. The PEI dataset is designed to provide a comprehensive, systematic and reliable way to monitor the quality of elections worldwide. It includes disaggregated scores for each of the individual indicators, summary indices for the eleven dimensions of electoral integrity, and a PEI index score out of 100 to summarize the overall integrity of the election.\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThis study was conducted by Pippa Norris, Alessandro Nai, and Max Grömping for Harvard University's Electoral Integrity Project.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.electoralintegrityproject.com/pei-core-survey-items	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/harvard-university/electoral-integrity	{politics}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Election Year","Expert ID",State,Sex,"Age Range",Politician,Candidate,Activist,Monitor,"Election Official",Voter,Citizen,"Political Scale","Candidate Supported","Perceptions of Electoral Integrity Index","State Electoral Integrity","National Electoral Integrity","Laws Discriminated","Laws Favored Incumbent","Laws Restricted Citizen Rights","Electoral Laws Index","Election Managed Well","Voting Information Available","Election Officials Fair","Election Followed Law","Election Procedures Index","Boundaries Discriminated","Boundaries Favored Incumbent","Boundaries Impartial","Voting District Boundaries Index","Citizens Not Found in Register","Register Inaccurate","Ineligible Voters Registered","Voter Registration Index","Opposition Prevented","Women Provided Opportunity","Leaders Selected Candidates","Campaign Rallies Restricted","Party/Candidate Registration Index","Newspapers Balanced","Television Favored Incumbent","Media Access Fair","Media Coverage Fair","Social Media Exposed Fraud","Media Coverage Index","Subsidy Access Fair","Donation Access Fair","Campaign Accounts Transparent","Elections Bought by Rich","Resources Improperly Used","Campaign Finance Index","Voters Threatened with Violence","Fradulent Votes Cast","Voting Process Easy","Choice of Candidates","Postal Ballots Available","Disabled Provided Access","Expatriates Able to Vote","Internet Ballots Available","Voting Process Index","Ballot Boxes Secure","Results Announced Without Delay","Vote Count Fair","International Monitors Restricted","Domestic Monitors Restricted","Vote Count Index","Results Challenged","Protests Peaceful","Protests Violent","Dispute Resolved in Courts","Election Results Index","Authorities Impartial","Information Distributed","Authorities Scrutinized","Authorities Performed Well","Electoral Authorities Index","Election Rigged","Deadlines Restrictive","Voters Waited","Voters Intimidated","Multiple Ballots Cast","Machines Accurate","Records Secure","Votes Counted Quickly","Outcome Reflected Popular Will"}	726	85	61710	4001	0.7941176470588235

Take a closer look at how many people are employed compared to the total population, and see how it relates to different stuff like education, gender, race, and age groups.\n2. Look into how employment has changed over time for specific groups of people, like women, different age groups, and different races or ethnicities.\n3. See if there's any connection between the employment-to-population ratio and economic stuff like how much the country's making (GDP growth) or how many people are out of work [(unemployment rates)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/unemployment-rates-by-demographics-1978-2022)\n4. Find out if education levels have anything to do with how many people are employed in different racial and ethnic groups.\n5. Dive into what happens to employment rates during tough times like a recession or when the economy is doing well.\n6. Use the dataset to make predictions about what might happen with employment in the future.\n\n---\n\nIf you find this dataset useful, please consider giving it an upvote! 😊💝\n\n---\n\n### Checkout my

648	politics	Fact-Checking Facebook Politics Pages	### Context\n\nDuring the 2016 US presidential election, the phrase “fake news” found its way to the forefront in news articles, tweets, and fiery online debates the world over after misleading and untrue stories proliferated rapidly. [BuzzFeed News][1] analyzed over 1,000 stories from hyperpartisan political Facebook pages selected from the right, left, and mainstream media to determine the nature and popularity of false or misleading information they shared.\n \n### Content\n\nThis dataset supports the original story [“Hyperpartisan Facebook Pages Are Publishing False And Misleading Information At An Alarming Rate”][2] published October 20th, 2016. Here are more details on the methodology used for collecting and labeling the dataset (reproduced from the story):\n  \n**More on Our Methodology and Data Limitations**\n\n“Each of our raters was given a rotating selection of pages from each category on different days. In some cases, we found that pages would repost the same link or video within 24 hours, which caused Facebook to assign it the same URL. When this occurred, we did not log or rate the repeat post and instead kept the original date and rating. Each rater was given the same guide for how to review posts:\n \n* “*Mostly True*: The post and any related link or image are based on factual information and portray it accurately. This lets them interpret the event/info in their own way, so long as they do not misrepresent events, numbers, quotes, reactions, etc., or make information up. This rating does not allow for unsupported speculation or claims.\n \n* “*Mixture of True and False*: Some elements of the information are factually accurate, but some elements or claims are not. This rating should be used when speculation or unfounded claims are mixed with real events, numbers, quotes, etc., or when the headline of the link being shared makes a false claim but the text of the story is largely accurate. It should also only be used when the unsupported or false information is roughly equal to the accurate information in the post or link. Finally, use this rating for news articles that are based on unconfirmed information.    \n\n* “*Mostly False*: Most or all of the information in the post or in the link being shared is inaccurate. This should also be used when the central claim being made is false.    \n \n* “*No Factual Content*: This rating is used for posts that are pure opinion, comics, satire, or any other posts that do not make a factual claim. This is also the category to use for posts that are of the “Like this if you think...” variety.\n \n“In gathering the Facebook engagement data, the API did not return results for some posts. It did not return reaction count data for two posts, and two posts also did not return comment count data. There were 70 posts for which the API did not return share count data. We also used CrowdTangle's API to check that we had entered all posts from all nine pages on the assigned days. In some cases, the API returned URLs that were no longer active. We were unable to rate these posts and are unsure if they were subsequently removed by the pages or if the URLs were returned in error.”\n \n### Acknowledgements\n \nThis dataset was originally published on GitHub by BuzzFeed News here: https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-10-facebook-fact-check \n \n### Inspiration\n \nHere are some ideas for exploring the hyperpartisan echo chambers on Facebook:\n \n* How do left, mainstream, and right categories of Facebook pages differ in the stories they share?\n\n* Which types of stories receive the most engagement from their Facebook followers? Are videos or links more effective for engagement?\n\n* Can you replicate BuzzFeed’s findings that “the least accurate pages generated some of the highest numbers of shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook”?\n\n\n#[Start a new kernel][3]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/buzzfeed\n  [2]: https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis?utm_term=.kq9kqJDZ2#.ia1QB2KJl.\n  [3]: https://www.kaggle.com/buzzfeed/fact-checking-facebook-politics-pages/kernels?modal=true	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/mrisdal/fact-checking-facebook-politics-pages	{politics,internet,"social networks"}	{unknown}	{account_id,post_id,Category,Page,"Post URL","Date Published","Post Type",Rating,Debate,share_count,reaction_count,comment_count}	2282	12	27384	2058	0.7352941176470589

650	politics	Fatalities in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict	This dataset provides information on the individuals killed during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since the second intifada, which began in September 2000. The data has been meticulously collected and investigated by B’Tselem – The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories. \n\nThe dataset includes statistics on all human beings – Palestinians, Israelis, and foreign nationals – who lost their lives during this conflict. It provides details such as name, age, citizenship, date of death, gender, participation in hostilities, place of residence, type of injury, ammunition used, and more.\n\n## Some Task Ideas:\n\n1. **Analyze Fatality Trends**: Explore the dataset and track the trends in fatalities over time. Identify any significant changes, spikes, or declines in the number of fatalities.\n2. **Demographic Analysis**: Conduct a demographic analysis by examining the age, gender, and citizenship of the individuals killed. Determine if there are any notable patterns or disparities in the data.\n3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilize the event location, district, and region information to perform geospatial analysis. Visualize the distribution of fatalities on a map and identify areas that have experienced higher levels of violence.\n4. **Hostilities Participation Analysis**: Investigate the extent of individuals' participation in hostilities before their deaths. Analyze the relationship between participation and the circumstances surrounding each fatality.\n5. **Injury Analysis**: Examine the types of injuries inflicted on individuals. Identify the most common types of injuries and assess their severity.\n6. **Weapons Used**: Analyze the ammunition and means by which the individuals were killed. Determine the most frequently used weapons or methods and evaluate their impact.\n7. **Victim Profiles**: Create profiles of the victims based on the available data such as age, gender, citizenship, and place of residence. Identify common characteristics among the victims.\n\n---\n\n&gt; Please note that the dataset contains sensitive information and focuses on the humanitarian aspect rather than taking any political stance.\n\n---\n\nIf you find this dataset valuable, don't forget to hit the upvote button! 😊💝 \n\n---\n\n## Related Datasets\n\n[Data on Palestinian Structures Israel Demolished](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/data-on-palestinian-structures-israel-demolished/)\n\n[Daily Public Opinion on Israel-Palestine War](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/reddit-on-israel-palestine-daily-updated)\n\n---\n\nPhoto by [Levi Meir Clancy](https://unsplash.com/@levimeirclancy?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/LheHIV3XpGM?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/fatalities-in-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict	{military,politics,"data analytics","social issues and advocacy","middle east"}	{CC0-1.0}	{name,date_of_event,age,citizenship,event_location,event_location_district,event_location_region,date_of_death,gender,took_part_in_the_hostilities,place_of_residence,place_of_residence_district,type_of_injury,ammunition,killed_by,notes}	11124	16	177984	7539	1
651	politics	Fatal US Police Violence	In 2015, The Post began tracking details about each police-involved killing in the United States — the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the person was experiencing a mental-health crisis — by manually culling local news reports, collecting information from law enforcement websites and social media, and monitoring independent databases such as [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/) and the now-defunct Killed by Police project. In many cases, The Post conducts additional reporting.\n\nIn 2022, The Post updated its database to standardize and publish the names of the police agencies involved in each shooting to better measure accountability at the department level.\n\nThe 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. began a protest movement culminating in the Black Lives Matter movement and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. In this data set, The Post tracks only shootings with circumstances closely paralleling those like the killing of Brown — incidents in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths in this data set.\n\nThe FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention log fatal shootings by police, but officials acknowledge that their data is incomplete. Since 2015, The Post has documented more than twice as many fatal shootings by police as recorded by federal officials on average annually.

Does it receive the appropriate scrutiny or attention?  How does "Likeability" relate to electoral success? What factors impact a political candidate's favorables?  This data set has enough strength to stand on its own, but also serves as a good input to a broader analysis.  Does a candidate's favorables have "seasonality"? Do their ratings go up or down as election day nears? Does distance make the heart grow fonder? Can we forecast a candidate's favorables? What is more important, a candidate's absolute number or their margin relative to their opponent for electoral success?

It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. Federal agencies are required to disclose any information requested under the FOIA unless it falls under one of nine exemptions which protect interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement. As Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court have all recognized, the Act is a vital part of our democracy.\n\nA FOIA request can be made for any agency record. You can also specify the format in which you wish to receive the records (for example, printed or electronic form). The Act does not require agencies to create new records or to conduct research, analyze data, or answer questions when responding to requests. Each federal agency handles its own records in response to requests. There are currently one hundred agencies subject to the FOIA with several hundred offices that process FOIA requests.\n\n\n# Content\n\nAnnual Freedom of Information Act Reports are submitted to Congress and published by FOIA.gov to promote agency accountability for the administration of the Act.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/doj/foia-requests	{business,military,politics}	{CC0-1.0}	{Agency,Department,Year,"Requests Pending Start Year","Requests Received","Requests Processed","Requests Pending End Year","Released in Full Ratio","Released in Part Ratio","Denied in Full Ratio"}	2261	10	22610	567	0.8235294117647058
656	politics	GapMinder - Income Inequality	## Content\n\nThis analysis focuses on income inequailty as measured by the Gini Index* and its association with economic metrics such as GDP per capita, investments as a % of GDP, and tax revenue as a % of GDP. One polical metric, EIU democracy index, is also included.\n\nThe data is for years 2006 - 2016\n\nThis investigation can be considered a starting point for complex questions such as:\n\n1. Is a higher tax revenue as a % of GDP associated with less income inequality?\n2. Is a higher EIU democracy index associated with less income inequality?\n3. Is higher GDP per capita associated with less income inequality?\n4. Is higher investments as a % of GDP associated with less income inequality?\n\nThis analysis uses the gapminder dataset from the Gapminder Foundation.  The Gapminder Foundation is a non-profit venture registered in Stockholm, Sweden, that promotes sustainable global development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by increased use and understanding of statistics and other information about social, economic and environmental development at local, national and global levels.\n\n*The [Gini Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation's residents, and is the most commonly used measurement of inequality. It was developed by the Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini and published in his 1912 paper Variability and Mutability.\n\nThe dataset contains data from the following GapMinder datasets:\n\n### EIU Democracy Index:\n\n"This democracy index is using the data from the Economist Inteligence Unit to express the quality of democracies as a number between 0 and 100. It's based on 60 different aspects of societies that are relevant to democracy universal suffrage for all adults, voter participation, perception of human rights protection and freedom to form organizations and parties.\nThe democracy index is calculated from the 60 indicators, divided into five ""sub indexes"", which are:\n\n1. Electoral pluralism index;\n2. Government index;\n3. Political participation indexm;\n4. Political culture index;\n5. Civil liberty index.\n\nThe sub-indexes are based on the sum of scores on roughly 12 indicators per sub-index, converted into a score between 0 and 100.\n(The Economist publishes the index with a scale from 0 to 10, but Gapminder has converted it to 0 to 100 to make it easier to communicate as a percentage.)"\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0noZrwAWxNBTDSfDgG06_aLGWUz4R6fgDhRaUZbDzE/edit#gid=935776888\n\n\n### Income: GDP per capita, constant PPP dollars\n\nGDP per capita measures the value of everything produced in a country during a year, divided by the number of people. The unit is in international dollars, fixed 2011 prices. The data is adjusted for inflation and differences in the cost of living between countries, so-called PPP dollars. The end of the time series, between 1990 and 2016, uses the latest GDP per capita data from the World Bank, from their World Development Indicators. To go back in time before the World Bank series starts in 1990, we have used several sources, such as Angus Maddison.\nhttps://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd001/\n\n\n### Investments (% of GDP)\nCapital formation is a term used to describe the net capital accumulation during an accounting period for a particular country. The term refers to additions of capital goods, such as equipment, tools, transportation assets, and electricity. Countries need capital goods to replace the older ones that are used to produce goods and services. If a country cannot replace capital goods as they reach the end of their useful lives, production declines. Generally, the higher the capital formation of an economy, the faster an economy can grow its aggregate income.\n\n\n### Tax revenue (% of GDP)\nrefers to compulsory transfers to the central governement for public purposes.  Does not include social security.\nhttps://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS\n\n## Context\n\nGapminder is an independent Swedish foundation with no political, religious or economic affiliations. Gapminder is a fact tank, not a think tank. Gapminder fights devastating misconceptions about global development. Gapminder produces free teaching resources making the world understandable based on reliable statistics. Gapminder promotes a fact-based worldview everyone can understand.

Without more information about the study, it is difficult to provide a detailed analysis. However, based on the title and the use of a Twitter dataset, it is likely that the study involves the use of sentiment analysis techniques to analyze the opinions and sentiment expressed in the dataset.\n<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7bf6f8c804cf1ec62e2cbbc7c85ea7dfd65b4848df48be4218e24012c6eb3430/68747470733a2f2f692e6d6f72696f682e636f6d2f323032302f30322f30342f6265656633366664373037642e6a7067">\n\nThe use of Twitter data for sentiment analysis has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the massive volume of data available and the ease with which opinions and sentiment can be expressed on the platform. By analyzing Twitter data, researchers can gain insights into public opinion and sentiment on a wide range of topics, from politics to consumer products to social issues.\n\nTo conduct a Twitter analysis, researchers typically collect a dataset of tweets related to a particular topic or set of topics. This dataset may include features such as the Twitter username, the tweet content, the time and date of the tweet, and any associated metadata such as hashtags or mentions. The dataset can then be processed using NLP or sentiment analysis techniques to classify the sentiment expressed in each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nThe dataset contains tweets from the Twitter API that were scraped for seven hashtags:\n\n**#Messi:**  This hashtag refers to the Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi, and is commonly used by fans and followers to discuss his performances, accomplishments, and news related to his career.\n\n**#FIFAWorldCup:**  This hashtag is used during the FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial international soccer tournament. Tweets with this hashtag may discuss news, scores, or analysis related to the tournament.\n\n**#DeleteFacebook:**  This hashtag is used by people who advocate for deleting or boycotting Facebook, often in response to controversies related to data privacy, political advertising, or other issues related to the social media giant.\n\n**#MeToo:**  This hashtag is used in the context of the Me Too movement, a social movement against sexual harassment and assault, particularly in the workplace. Tweets with this hashtag may share personal stories, express support for the movement, or discuss related news and events.\n\n**#BlackLivesMatter:**  This hashtag is used in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, a movement against police brutality and systemic racism towards Black people. Tweets with this hashtag may express support for the movement, share news and updates, or discuss related issues.\n\n**#NeverAgain:**  This hashtag is used in the context of the Never Again movement, which advocates for gun control and other measures to prevent school shootings and other acts of gun violence.\n\n**#BarCamp:**  This hashtag refers to BarCamp, an international network of unconferences - participant-driven conferences that are open and free to attend. Tweets with this hashtag may discuss upcoming BarCamp events, share insights or learnings from past events, or express support for the BarCamp community.\n\n The sentiment score was generated using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, and represents the overall sentiment of the tweet (positive, negative, or neutral).\n\nThe data can be used to gain insights into how people are discussing and reacting to these topics on Twitter, and how the sentiment towards these hashtags may have evolved over time. Researchers and analysts can use this dataset for sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning applications.\n\nSome potential analyses that can be performed on the data include sentiment trend analysis over time, geographical distribution of sentiments, and topic modeling to identify themes and topics that emerge from the tweets.\n\nOverall, the dataset provides a rich resource for researchers and analysts interested in studying social and political issues on social media.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/joyshil0599/unleashing-social-sentiments-a-twitter-analysis	{global,intermediate,"data analytics",tabular,"social networks"}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Account Link","Account profie picture","Account name","Mention tag","People opinion",Hashatg,"People Opinion","Profile Picture","Accout Name","Pepole openion",hashtag}	4381	26	21930	1695	0.9411764705882353

It is a composite index, a combination of surveys and assessments of corruption, collected by a variety of reputable institutions. The CPI is the most widely used indicator of corruption worldwide.\n\n### Content\n\nThis CPI dataset is for 10 years from 2010 to 2019; it contains data about 180 countries in the world, so it's a global dataset.\nIt was generated by the following steps :\n\n1.

678	politics	Member States of the European Union	# Context \n\nThe European Union is a unique economic and political union between twenty-eight countries that together cover much of the continent. It was created in the aftermath of the Second World War to foster economic cooperation and thus avoid conflict. The result was the European Economic Community (EEC), established in 1958, with Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as its members. What began as an economic union has evolved into an organization spanning policy areas, from climate, environment and health to external relations and security, justice and migration. The 1993 name change from the European Economic Community (EEC) to the European Union (EU) reflected this.\n\nThe European Union has delivered more than half a century of peace, stability and prosperity, helped raise living standards and launched a single European currency: the Euro. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for advancing the causes of peace, reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe. The single market is the EU's main economic engine, enabling most goods, services, money and people to move freely.\n\n\n# Content\n\nThe European Union covers over 4 million square kilometers and has 508 million inhabitants — the world’s third largest population after China and India. This dataset includes information on each EU member state, candidate state, or European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) signatory state.\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThe membership, population, and economic data was published by the European Commission's Eurostat.

693	politics	Sacred Games  	### Context\n\nDo you know that Pakistan is the second most dangerous country in the world to be a politician or to run the elections? Thirty politicians have been killed in fifty-one attacks in last 70 years, and the trend does not seem to change its trajectory. Out of those participating in these political rallies, 734 got killed and 1,752 were injured. \n\nIt all started with the assassination of the first Prime Minister [Liaquat Ali Khan][1] on October 16, 1951. Hayat Sherpao, General Zia-ul-Haq, Siddiq Khan Kanju, Hakim Muhammad Saeed, Azam Tariq, Imran Farooq, Iqbal Masih, Shahzad Bhatti, Salman Taseer, Bashir Bilour, Abdul Raziq Bugti, Bungal Bugti, Benazir Bhutto and most recently Haroon Bilour and Siraj Raisani were added to the list of assassinated Pakistani politicians. There were a few failed attempts too, for example, Pervez Musharraf survived four while MQM’s Izhar-ul-hassan and Rashid Godil escaped one assassination attempts each. Moreover, I am not counting assassinations carried out by state-actors like for Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Akbar Bugti, Murtaza Bhutto and Shahnawaz Bhutto.        \nMexico comes at first place with [133 politicians killed][2], Russia comes [third with 33][3] and India comes at [fourth place with 23][4] – Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Partab Singh, Phoolan Devi and Pramod Mahajan are few notable ones. The list includes 1 prime minister, 2 opposition leaders, 3 home ministers and 2 chief ministers.    \n\nThere is also an old recipe of using violence and killings as an apparatus for election delays, maneuvers and control.  The history of elections and the violence go hand in hand – [92 people getting killed][5] in Kenya’s election or [31 in Honduras][6], [80 candidates in Mexico][7] or [11 in Assam, India][8], or even [74 in Pakistan’s last elections][9]. \n\nThe deadly cycle of violence has already started for this election. Haroon Bilour of Awami National Party (ANP) got killed with 20 others and 65 wounded in a [suicide bombing attack][10] in Peshawar. 149 got killed, and 186 left injured in a deadly suicide bombing attack on [BAP’s leader Siraj Raisani][11]. Four people died, and 10 got injured after an explosion near JUI-F’s [Akram Durrani rally in Bannu][12]. And former senator and ANP leader [Daud Achakzai got injured][13] in a firing incident at Qilla Abdullah, Baluchistan. Total tally comes to 174 dead, and 262 injured so far, making it one of the deadliest elections in Pakistan.  Mastung blast is the second most lethal terrorist attack in the history of Pakistan with 149 dead, 139 people died in 2007 attack on Benazir Bhutto in Karachi, and 150 killed in the APS attack in Peshawar in 2014.\n\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset contains the following fields:\n\nSerial No, Politicians Name, Day, Date, Day Type, Time, City, Province, Location, Location Type, Latitude, Longitude, Party Name, Number of people killed and Injured and Target Status (Survived or Dead).\n\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe dataset should be referenced as “Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani, Shams-ul-Arfeen, Sana Rasheed, Assassination of Pakistan’s Politicians (1951-2018), Kaggle, July 16, 2018.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nHere is the list of ideas we are working on and like you to help.

696	politics	Subjective Well-Being of Africa 2020	### Context\n\nThis project analyzes the 2020 World Happiness Report to draw conclusions about the general well being of Africa. It uses several CSV files consisting of survey responses formed from a Google Form survey, data from the 2020 World Happiness Report and data on countries only in Africa from the 2020 World Happiness Report. The main data set used includes over 150 countries and their happiness scores, freedom to make life choices, social support, healthy life expectancy, regional indicator, perceptions of corruption and generosity. This analysis was done to answer the following data-driven questions: 'Which African country ranked the happiest in 2020?' and 'Which variable predicts or explains Africa's happiness score?'\n\nThis project includes several programs created in R and Python.\n\n### Background\n\nThe Gallup World Poll (GWP) is conducted annually to measure and track public attitudes concerning political, social and economic issues, including controversial and sensitive subjects. Annually, this poll tracks attitudes toward law and order, institutions and infrastructure, jobs, well-being and other topics for approximately 150 countries worldwide. The data gathered from the GWP is used to create an annual World Happiness Report (WHR). The World Happiness Report is conducted to review the science of understanding and measuring the subjective well-being and to use survey measures of life satisfaction to track the quality of lives in over 150 countries.\n\nAt first glance, it seems that world happiness isn't important or maybe it's just an emotional thing. However, several governments have started to look at happiness as a metric to measure success. Happiness Scores or Subjective Well-being (SWB) are national average responses to questions of life evaluation. They are important because they remind policy makers and people in power that happiness is based on social capital, not just financial. Happiness is often considered an essential and useful way to guide public policies and measure their effectiveness. It is also important to note that happiness scores point out the importance of qualitative rather than quantitative. At times, quality is better than quantity.\n\nAfrica is the world's second largest and second most populous continent in the world. It consists of 54 countries meaning that Africa has the most countries. Africa has approximately 30% of the earth's mineral resources and has the largest reserves of precious metals. Africa reserves over 40% of the gold reserves, 60% on cobalt and 90% of platinum. However, Africa unfortunately has the most developmental challenges. It is the world's poorest and most underdeveloped continent. Africa is also almost 100% colonized with the exceptions of Ethiopia and Liberia. Given this information, one can wonder what the SWB or state of happiness is in Africa?\n\nThis site analyzes the 2020 World Happiness Report to draw conclusions to data-drive questions listed later on this page. The focus is specifically on countries in Africa. Even though there are 54 countries in Africa, only 43 participated in the 2020 WHR.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset used is generated from the 'World Happiness Report 2020'. This dataset contains the Happiness Score for over 150 countries for the year of 2020. The data gathered from the Gallup World Poll gives a national average of Happiness scores for countries all over the world. It is a annual landmark survey of the state of global happiness.\n\nThis dataset is from the data repository "Kaggle". On Kaggle's dataset page, I searched for Africa Happiness after filtering the search to CSV file type. I wasn't able to find any datasets that could answer my questions that didn't include other countries from different continents. I decided to use a Global Happiness Report to answer the questions I have. The dataset I am using was publish by Micheal Londeen and it was created on March 24, 2020. His main source is the World Happiness Report for 2020.\n\n### Variables\n\nHappiness score or subjective well-being (variable name ladder ): The survey measure of SWB is from the Feb 28, 2020 release of the Gallup World Poll (GWP) covering years from 2005 to 2019. Unless stated otherwise, it is the national average response to the question of life evaluations. The English wording of the question is “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder, or just life ladder in our analysis.\n\nHealthy Life Expectancy (HLE). Healthy life expectancies at birth are based on the data extracted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository. The data at the source are available for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2016. To match this report’s sample period (2005-2019), interpolation and extrapolation are used.\n\nSocial support (or having someone to count on in times of trouble) is the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the GWP question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”\n\nFreedom to make life choices is the national average of responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n\nGenerosity is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.\n\nCorruption Perception: The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” The overall perception is just the average of the two 0-or-1 responses. In case the perception of government corruption is missing, we use the perception of business corruption as the overall perception. The corruption perception at the national level is just the average response of the overall perception at the individual level.\n\nSource: https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/WHR20_Ch2_Statistical_Appendix.pdf\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI did not create all of this data, some was sourced.

People were kidnapped from the continent of Africa, forced into slavery in the American colonies and exploited to work as indentured servants. Families were ripped apart, history lost, heritages and customs uprooted and destroyed. Africa has a very sad history with the inclusion of slavery and colonialism. Before colonialism ruled, Africa had over 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs. After being uprooted from there home, much of that has been lost. This may include the removal of roots, traditions, and even identity. It is also crucial to point out that African's being removed from their home didn't allow them to truly develop and protect their home.\n\nThis is very close to home because unfortunately, this is the reality of my ancestors. My great great grandparents were enslaved and I'm sure many more of my forefathers were. As a result, my family has lost their true history. It is disheartening to know that a part of my identity is lost in not being able to truly know where my ancestors are from and what customs, traditions and cultures we had. What language and practices did my ancestors speak and do? So many questions that I may never know the answer to. Based on the history and current state of Africa: What is the SWB of Africa? Has colonialism affected the happiness of Africa? Does Africa's sad history cause it to rank low in annual happiness reports? Which country in Africa is the happiest? The saddest? What factors or variables explain the happiness of Africa?	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/diondrakimberly/subjective-wellbeing-of-africa-2020	{politics,"social science",economics}	{CC-BY-SA-4.0}	{"Country Name","Regional Indicator","Happiness Scores","Social Support","Healthy Life Expectancy","Freedom to Make Life Choices",Generosity,"Perceptions of Corruption",Timestamp,"How old are you?","Which African country do you think had the highest happiness rank in 2020?","Do you think social support (family, friends, someone to rely on in a time of need, etc.) has an affect on the overall happiness of a country?

700	politics	Trump Approval Ratings	Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current president of the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality.\n\nTrump was born and raised in Queens, a borough of New York City, and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School. He took charge of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded its operations from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. He bought the Miss Universe brand of beauty pageants in 1996 and sold it in 2015. Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies. He produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television series, from 2003 to 2015. As of 2020, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $2.1 billion.\n\nTrump's political positions have been described as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and was elected in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although he lost the popular vote. He became the oldest first-term U.S. president and the first without prior military or government service. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax-cut package for individuals and businesses, rescinding the individual health insurance mandate penalty. He appointed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an America First agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He imposed import tariffs which triggered a trade war with China, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and withdrew U.S. troops from northern Syria. Trump met thrice with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, but talks on denuclearization broke down in 2019.\n\nA special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller found that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia.[d] Mueller also investigated Trump for obstruction of justice, and his report neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that offense. After Trump solicited the investigation by Ukraine of a political rival, Joe Biden, who later became his presumptive Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election, the House of Representatives impeached him in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate acquitted him of both charges in February 2020. \n\nData is being taken from https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/\n\n"approval_polllist.csv" contains President Trump's job approval ratings.\n\n"approval_topline.csv" contains a trendline for the approval ratings.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/soham1024/trump-approval-ratings	{politics}	{other}	{president,subgroup,modeldate,startdate,enddate,pollster,grade,samplesize,population,weight,influence,approve,disapprove,adjusted_approve,adjusted_disapprove,multiversions,tracking,url,poll_id,question_id,createddate,timestamp,approve_estimate,approve_hi,approve_lo,disapprove_estimate,disapprove_hi,disapprove_lo}	19483	32	380674	24763	0.8235294117647058

Dates on the *weekend* (Saturday and Sunday), as well as *federal holidays*, are **excluded** from the debt tracker because the Treasury's fiscal data do not account for those days. Recent political debates in the US over the **potential raising of the debt ceiling** has inspired me to create this dataset. Personally, I believe that the issue will continue to dominate political discourse due to the **increasing polarization between Democrats and Republicans.**\n\n# Data Sources\n##### The primary data source used was the U.S. Treasury's official website, which publishes fiscal data pertaining to the American government. Considering the meticulous documentation of federal spending by the Treasury, no other authority is more equipped to provide insight on US debt.\n\n1. [U.S. Treasury's FiscalData Website](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny) - The United States Department of the Treasury published daily updates on the national debt since April 1st, 1993. However, intragovernmental holdings and total public debt outstanding have only been accounted for at the end of each fiscal year since 1997. Daily updates for those two statistics officially began since March 31st, 2005.\n2. [U.S. Treasury's Finance Guide to the National Debt](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/) - The United States Department of the Treasury released a detailed overview of the national debt and how it operates in conjunction with American society.

Eligibility varies by country, and the voting-eligible population should not be confused with the total adult population. Age and citizenship status are often among the criteria used to determine eligibility, but some countries further restrict eligibility based on sex, race, or religion.\n# Context\nThe historical trends in voter turnout in the United States presidential elections have been determined by the gradual expansion of voting rights from the initial restriction to white male property owners aged 21 or older in the early years of the country's independence, to all citizens aged 18 or older in the mid-20th century. Voter turnout in United States presidential elections has historically been higher than the turnout for midterm elections.\n![f](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/U.S._Vote_for_President_as_Population_Share.png)\n# Content\nTurnout rates by demographic breakdown from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, November Voting and Registration Supplement (or CPS for short).

I decided to create this dataset to explore how American views on abortion have evolved in the decades preceding the Dobbs V. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. In that particular court case, the Supreme Court also overturned the **1973 Roe V. Wade decision**, ending the *long-standing constitutional right to abortion* in the United States. Abortion has become a fixture of American politics in recent years, but few are able to take a bipartisan stance on the issue. I hope that the **objectiveness of the quantitative data** in this dataset can allow for a **more rational understanding** of the issue.\n\n\n# Data Sources\n##### The primary data source used was Gallup, an analytics company renowned for its expansive public opinion polls. With decades worth of data on the sentiments of Americans, Gallup is an organization uniquely equipped to illustrate the shifting attitudes on abortion. \n\n1. [Gallup's Historical Trends On Abortion](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx) - Gallup publicly released not only their opinion data about abortion, but also attached corresponding visualizations that conveyed to me the analytical potential of a compiled dataset.\n2. [Gallup's "Where Do Americans Stand On Abortion?"](https://news.gallup.com/poll/321143/americans-stand-abortion.aspx) - While searching for quality data sources regarding abortion (ex. MMWR, CDC, PMSS), I found this Gallup article, which piqued my interest and led me to their "Historical Trends" page.\n\n# Reponses Being Tracked\n- Q1꞉ Should Abortions Be Legal?\n- Q2꞉ Are You Pro-Choice Or Pro-Life (AFTER)?\n- Q2꞉ Are You Pro-Choice Or Pro-Life (NOT AFTER)?\n- Q3꞉ Should Roe V.

Never in the past has any single party secured a similar mandate. UP with a population of around 220 million is as big as the whole of united states. It has 403 constituencies each having its own demographic breakup. The election was conducted in 7 phases.\n\n\n# Content\nThe dataset has 8 variables:\n\nseat_allotment: As some of you might be aware that there was a coalition between INC and SP which materialized pretty late into the campaign. Hence, in a few constituencies the high command of the 2 parties could not convince contestants to forfeit their nomination. In such constituencies, there is a situation that is called a friendly fight(FF) where candidates from both parties INC and SP are contesting instead of just one. \nThese constituencies are marked by the flag FF (Friendly Fight). Others are INC (contested by INC), SP(Contested by SP) and DNC(Contested by none)\n\nphase: The phase in which the election was conducted.\n\nac_no: Assembly constituency number\n\nac: Assembly constituency name\n\ndistrict: District to which the ac belongs\n\ncandidate: Candidate name\n\nparty: Party name\n\nvotes: votes for each candidate\n\nSource: Scraped from eciresults.nic.in	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/ankit2106/uttar-pradesh-assembly-elections-2017	{government,politics}	{CC0-1.0}	{seat_allotment,phase,ac_no,ac,district,candidate,party,votes}	5256	8	42048	0	0.8235294117647058

802	chemistry	Mice Protein Expression	### Context\n\nExpression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear conditioning, a task used to assess associative learning.\n\n### Content\n\nThe data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of cortex. There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for a total of 72 mice. In the experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse. Therefore, for control mice, there are 38x15, or 570 measurements, and for trisomic mice, there are 34x15, or 510 measurements. The dataset contains a total of 1080 measurements per protein. Each measurement can be considered as an independent sample/mouse. \n\nThe eight classes of mice are described based on features such as genotype, behavior and treatment. According to genotype, mice can be control or trisomic. According to behavior, some mice have been stimulated to learn (context-shock) and others have not (shock-context) and in order to assess the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice, some mice have been injected with the drug and others have not. \n\nClasses: \n\n1. **c-CS-s**: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) \n\n2. **c-CS-m**: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) \n\n3. **c-SC-s**: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) \n\n4. **c-SC-m**: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice) \n\n5. **t-CS-s**: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (7 mice) \n\n6. **t-CS-m**: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice) \n\n7. **t-SC-s**: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice) \n\n8. **t-SC-m**: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice)\n\n### Attribute Information\n\n[1] **Mouse ID** \n\n[2:78] **Values of expression levels of 77 proteins**; the names of proteins are followed by N indicating that they were measured in the nuclear fraction. *For example: DYRK1A_n*\n\n[79] **Genotype**: control (c) or trisomy (t) \n\n[80] **Treatment type**: memantine (m) or saline (s) \n\n[81] **Behavior**: context-shock (CS) or shock-context (SC) \n\n[82] **Class**: c-CS-s, c-CS-m, c-SC-s, c-SC-m, t-CS-s, t-CS-m, t-SC-s, t-SC-m\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nClara Higuera Department of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Informatics and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Chemistry, University Complutense, Madrid, Spain. \nEmail: clarahiguera at ucm.es \n\nKatheleen J.

720	politics	Young People Survey	# Introduction\n\nIn 2013, students of the Statistics class at [FSEV\nUK](https://fses.uniba.sk/en/) were asked to invite their friends to\nparticipate in this survey.\n\n* The data file (`responses.csv`) consists of 1010 rows and 150 columns (139\ninteger and 11 categorical).\n* For convenience, the original variable names were shortened in the\ndata file. See the `columns.csv` file if you want to match the data with the original names.\n* The data contain missing values.\n* The survey was presented to participants in both electronic and written form.\n* The original questionnaire was in Slovak language and was later translated\ninto English.\n* All participants were of Slovakian nationality, aged between 15-30.\n\nThe variables can be split into the following groups:\n\n* **Music preferences** (19 items)\n* **Movie preferences** (12 items)\n* **Hobbies & interests** (32 items)\n* **Phobias** (10 items)\n* **Health habits** (3 items)\n* **Personality traits, views on life, & opinions** (57 items)\n* **Spending habits** (7 items)\n* **Demographics** (10 items)\n\n# Research questions\n\nMany different techniques can be used to answer many questions, e.g.\n\n* **Clustering:** Given the music preferences, do people make up\nany clusters of similar behavior?\n* **Hypothesis testing:** Do women fear certain phenomena\nsignificantly more than men? Do the left handed people have different\ninterests than right handed?\n* **Predictive modeling:** Can we predict spending habits of a person\nfrom his/her interests and movie or music preferences?\n* **Dimension reduction:** Can we describe a large number of human\ninterests by a smaller number of latent concepts?\n* **Correlation analysis:** Are there any connections between music and\nmovie preferences?\n* **Visualization:** How to effectively visualize a lot of variables\nin order to gain some meaningful insights from the data?\n* **(Multivariate) Outlier detection:** Small number of participants often cheats and randomly answers the questions. Can you identify them? Hint: [Local outlier factor][1] may help.\n* **Missing values analysis:** Are there any patterns in missing responses? What is the optimal way of imputing the values in surveys?\n* **Recommendations:** If some of user's interests are known, can we predict the other? Or, if we know what a person listen, can we predict which kind of movies he/she might like?\n\n# Past research\n\n* (in slovak) Sleziak, P. - Sabo, M.: Gender differences in the prevalence of specific phobias.

725	agriculture	AgriSeshat: Agriculture Dataset	### Context\n\nThe Seshat: Global History Databank is an international scientific research project of the nonprofit Evolution Institute. Founded in 2011, the Seshat: Global History Databank gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses. The Databank consults directly with expert scholars to code what historical societies and their environments were like in the form of accessible datapoints and thus forms a digital storehouse for data on the political and social organization of all human groups from the early modern back to the ancient and neolithic periods.The organizers of this research project contend that the mass of data then can be used to test a variety of competing hypotheses about the rise and fall of large-scale societies around the globe which may help science provide answers to global problems.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seshat_(project)\n\nTurchin, P., R.

The information about the sectors and the counts of firms are listed respectively as Irrigation (114), Public Health (77), Buildings and Roads (82), Forest (70), Corporate (47), Animal Husbandry (95), Communication (1), Electrical (4), Land (5), Science and Technology (3), Tourism (1), Fisheries (41), Industries (37), Agriculture (200).\n\nThis research work is a case study of an external government audit company which is also the external auditor of government firms of India. During audit-planning, auditors examine the business of different government offices but the target to visit the offices with very-high likelihood and significance of misstatements. This is calculated by assessing the risk relevant to the financial reporting goals (Houston, Peters, and Pratt 1999). The three main objective of the study are as follow:\n\n1.\tTo understand the audit risk analysis work-flow of the company by in-depth interview with the audit employees, and to propose a decision-making framework for risk assessment of firms during audit planning.\n2.\tTo examine the present and historical risk factors for determining the Risk Audit Score for 777 target firms, to implement the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to rank examined risk factors, and evaluating the Risk Audit Class (Fraud and No-Fraud) of nominated firms.\n\n3.\tTo examine the present and historical risk factors for determining the Risk Audit Score for 777 target firms, to implement the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to rank examined risk factors, and evaluating the Risk Audit Class (Fraud and No-Fraud) of nominated firms.\n\n\n\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/audit-data	{business,finance,software,classification,"binary classification"}	{CC0-1.0}	{Sector_score,LOCATION_ID,PARA_A,Score_A,Risk_A,PARA_B,Score_B,Risk_B,TOTAL,numbers,Score_B.1,Risk_C,Money_Value,Score_MV,Risk_D,District_Loss,PROB,RiSk_E,History,Prob,Risk_F,Score,Inherent_Risk,CONTROL_RISK,Detection_Risk,Audit_Risk,Risk,SCORE_A,SCORE_B,Marks,MONEY_Marks,District,Loss,LOSS_SCORE,History_score}	1552	45	34920	2	0.8529411764705882
727	agriculture	Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Degradation 1999-2019	### Context\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.\n\nThe region provides important benefits to communities living near and far. Nearly 500 indigenous communities call the Amazon rainforest home. It’s a highly biodiverse ecosystem, home to untold species of plants and animals. The rainforest can create its own weather and influence climates around the world. Unfortunately, the fragile ecosystem faces the constant threat of deforestation and fires (for natural or anthropogenic causes).\n\nDeforestation happens for many reasons, such as illegal agriculture, natural disasters, urbanization and mining. There are several ways to remove forests - burning and logging are two methods. Although deforestation is happening all over the world today, it is an especially critical issue in the Amazon rainforests, as the only large forest still standing in the world. There, the species of plants and animals they harbor have been disappearing at an alarming rate.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset refers to 3 files:\n\n- **'inpe_brazilian_amazon_fires_1999_2019'** : amount of fire outbreaks in Brazilian Amazon by state, month and year, from 1999 to 2019. The original data are public and were extracted from INPE website on December 13th 2019, always from the filtering for the reference salellite and aggregated using Postgres SQL so that you could work with lighter files. \nProgram: [BDQ](http://queimadas.dgi.inpe.br/queimadas/bdqueimadas/) (Banco de Dados de Queimadas, or Fires Database).\nMethodology: detects fire outbreaks through satellite images, updated every 3 hours.\n\n\n- **'def_area_2004_2019'** : deforestation area (km²) by year and state, from 2004 to 2019. The data are public and were extracted from INPE website on December 16th 2019. It was already aggregated, so, no data process was made.\nProgram: [PRODES](http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes) (Programa de Monitoramento da Floresta Amazônica Brasileira por Satélite, or Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Monitoring Program by Satellite).\nMethodology: maps primary forest loss using satellite imagery, with 20 to 30 meters of spatial resolution and 16-day revisit rate, in a combination that seeks to minimize the problem of cloud cover and ensure interoperability criteria.\n\n- **'el_nino_la_nina_1999_2019'** : Data about start year, end year, and severity of 2 of the most important climatic phenomena.\nData were extracted from [Golden Gate Weather Services](https://ggweather.com/enso/oni.htm) on December 20th 2019 and were unpivoted.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI thank INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais), or, in English, National Institute for Space Research.

728	agriculture	COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset	&gt; ### “Health requires healthy food."###\nRoger Williams (1603 – 1683)\n\n<br>\nIn the past couple months, we’ve witnessed doctors, nurses, paramedics and thousands of medical workers putting their lives on the frontline to save patients who are infected. And as the battle with COVID-19 continues, we should all ask ourselves – What should we do to help out? What can we do to protect our loved ones, those who sacrifice for us, and ourselves from this pandemic?<br>\nThese questions all relate back to the CORD-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge Task Question: [“What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?” ](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=587)\n<br>\nAnd my simple answer is : **We need to protect our families and our own healths by adapting to a healthy diet.**\n<br>\n\n### Inspiration and Research Objectives\n\nThe USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion recommends a very simple daily diet intake guideline: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruits, and 20% protein, but are we really eating in the healthy eating style recommended by these food divisions and balances?\n<br>\nIn this dataset, I have combined data of different types of food, world population obesity and undernourished rate, and global COVID-19 cases count from around the world in order to learn more about how a healthy eating style could help combat the Corona Virus.

732	agriculture	Distirbution of crop production Kenya 2019 census	# Kenya Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is the engine of economic growth in Kenya.  About 75% of Kenyans earn all or part of their income from this sector.  Agriculture accounts for 33% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP).  Despite continuous population growth, agricultural productivity has stagnated in recent years.  Only 20% of Kenyan land is suitable for farming and that land is not utilized efficiently. Recurrent crises such as drought add to agricultural challenges.  In response to these challenges, USAID is increasing productivity for smallholder farmers.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe dataset contains a summary of the distribution of households practicing agriculture by county and sub-county level. Kenya currently has 47 counties (states) which contain several sub-counties. The dataset is based on the previous census enumeration done in 2019. \n\n### Content\n\nThe first row contains the total numbers for the whole country. i.e the row with "kenya" entry under County column. The dataset has 42 columns representing the county and corresponding number of household involved in production of that crop.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAfrica's Largest Volunteer Driven Open Data Platform OpenAFRICA aims to be the largest independent repository of open data on the African continent.

734	agriculture	Environment Impact of Food Production	### Context\n\nAs the world’s population has expanded and gotten richer, the demand for food, energy and water has seen a rapid increase. Not only has demand for all three increased, but they are also strongly interlinked: food production requires water and energy; traditional energy production demands water resources; agriculture provides a potential energy source. This article focuses on the environmental impacts of food. Ensuring everyone in the world has access to a nutritious diet in a sustainable way is one of the greatest challenges we face.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains most 43 most common foods grown across the globe and 23 columns as their respective land, water usage and carbon footprints. \n\nColumns\n1. Land use change - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product \n2. Animal Feed - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n3. Farm   - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n4. Processing - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n5. Transport - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n6. Packaging - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n7. Retail - Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product\n\nThese represent greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product) across different stages in the lifecycle of food production.\n\nEutrophication – the pollution of water bodies and ecosystems with excess nutrients – is a major environmental problem. The runoff of nitrogen and other nutrients from agricultural production systems is a leading contributor.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nhttps://ourworldindata.org\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\n1.

735	agriculture	Female Employment vs Socioeconimic Factors	### Context\n\nWomen roughly occupy half of the world's population but when it comes to the total workforce of a country, the percentage of male and female workers are rarely similar. This is even more prominent for the developing and underdeveloped countries. While several reasons such as the insufficient access to education, religious superstitions, lack of adequate infrastructures are responsible for this discrepancy, it goes way beyond these. And to show the effects of multiple socioeconomic factors on the participation of women in the total workforce, percentage of female employment in the total labor force has been considered. Using multiple linear regression model, the relationship between these factors can be analyzed.\n\n\n### Content\n\nFor the current study, the data set has been chosen from a survey performed on the population of Bangladesh. The datasets selected for this study span over 25 years (from 1995 to 2019). Data has been collected separately from multiple datasets from the World Bank databank for the employed women percentage and the related predictor variables. These datasets were compiled into one dataset and it corresponds to the 25 data points for the variables. There is one response variable which is the percentage of the employed women and 10 exlnanatory variables of predictors. Brief descriptions of these variables are given below.\n\n**PerFemEmploy**\nEmployment to population ratio (%) of women who are of age 15 or older. Employment to population ratio is the proportion of a country's population that is employed. Employment is defined as persons of working age who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit, whether at work during the reference period (i.e. who worked in a job for at least one hour) or not at work due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangements. Ages 15 and older are generally considered the working-age population.\n\n**FertilityRate**\nFertility rate (birth per women). Total fertility rate represents the number of children that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her childbearing years and bear children in accordance with age-specific fertility rates of the specified year.\n\n**RatioMaletoFemale**\nRatio of female to male labor force participation rate. Labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population ages 15 and older that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period. Ratio of female to male labor force participation rate is calculated by dividing female labor force participation rate by male labor force participation rate and multiplying by 100.\n\n**PerFemEmployers**\nEmployers, female (% of female employment). Employers are those workers who, working on their own account or with one or a few partners, hold the type of jobs defined as a "self-employment jobs" i.e. jobs where the remuneration is directly dependent upon the profits derived from the goods and services produced), and, in this capacity, have engaged, on a continuous basis, one or more persons to work for them as employee(s).\n\n**Agriculture**\nEmployment in agriculture, female (% of female employment). Employment is defined as persons of working age who were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit, whether at work during the reference period or not at work due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangement. The agriculture sector consists of activities in agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing, in accordance with division 1 (ISIC 2) or categories A-B (ISIC 3) or category A (ISIC 4).\n\n**Industry**\nEmployment in industry, female (% of female employment). The industry sector consists of mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction, and public utilities (electricity, gas, and water), in accordance with divisions 2-5 (ISIC 2) or categories C-F (ISIC 3) or categories B-F (ISIC 4).\n\n**Services**\nEmployment in services, female (% of female employment). The services sector consists of wholesale and retail trade and restaurants and hotels; transport, storage, and communications; financing, insurance, real estate, and business services; and community, social, and personal services, in accordance with divisions 6-9 (ISIC 2) or categories G-Q (ISIC 3) or categories G-U (ISIC 4).\n\n**Wage.Salaried**\nWage and salaried workers, female (% of female employment). Wage and salaried workers (employees) are those workers who hold the type of jobs defined as "paid employment jobs," where the incumbents hold explicit (written or oral) or implicit employment contracts that give them a basic remuneration that is not directly dependent upon the revenue of the unit for which they work.\n\n**ContrFamWorkers**\nContributing family workers, female (% of female employment). Contributing family workers are those workers who hold "self-employment jobs" as own-account workers in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same household.\n\n**OwnAccount**\nOwn-account female workers (% of employment). Own-account workers are workers who, working on their own account or with one or more partners, hold the types of jobs defined as "self-employment jobs" and have not engaged on a continuous basis any employees to work for them. Own account workers are a subcategory of "self-employed".\n\n**Vulnerable**\nVulnerable employment, female (% of female employment). Vulnerable employment is contributing family workers and own-account workers as a percentage of total employment.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nLinear model as well as other statistical methods can be applied on this dataset to analyze if there is any viable relationship between the predictor and the response variables.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/mdmuhtasimbillah/female-employment-vs-socioeconimic-factors	{law,economics,"jobs and career"}	{world-bank}	{ï»¿Year,PerFemEmploy,FertilityRate,Ratio_MaletoFemale,PerFemEmployers,Agriculture,Industry,Services,Wage&Salaried,ContrFamWorkers,OwnAccount,Vulnerable}	25	12	300	0	0.7647058823529411

736	agriculture	Food Prices in World	Food prices refer to the average price of particular food commodities.\n\nFood prices can vary a lot, and changes over time can often give us insights into the underlying markets and agricultural production within countries.\n\nThe price of foods gives an important indicator of the balance between agricultural production and market demand. These prices matter to consumers and producers. They have obvious impacts on consumer affordability. But they also affect the income of farmers and producers.\n\nIn low-to-middle-income countries, a large share of the population is employed in agriculture. Producers typically benefit from higher food prices; consumers from lower prices. Food markets can therefore have a strong impact on food affordability, hunger and undernourishment, and dietary quality.\n\nBy Hannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado and Max Roser (2023) - "Food Prices".	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/food-prices-in-world	{nutrition,business,"e-commerce services"}	{other}	{Entity,Code,Year,"Share of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet","Total food expenditure","Food as share of total consumer expenditure","Share of the population who cannot afford sufficient calories"}	1958	16	7832	66	0.7058823529411765

According to behavior, some mice have been stimulated to learn (context-shock) and others have not (shock-context) and in order to assess the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice, some mice have been injected with the drug and others have not.\n\nClasses:\nc-CS-s: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice)\nc-CS-m: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice)\nc-SC-s: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice)\nc-SC-m: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice)\n\nt-CS-s: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (7 mice)\nt-CS-m: trisomy mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice)\nt-SC-s: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice)\nt-SC-m: trisomy mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (9 mice)\n\nThe aim is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between the classes.\n\n\nAttribute Information:\n\n1 Mouse ID\n2..78 Values of expression levels of 77 proteins; the names of proteins are followed by â€œ_nâ€ indicating that they were measured in the nuclear fraction. For example: DYRK1A_n\n79 Genotype: control (c) or trisomy (t)\n80 Treatment type: memantine (m) or saline (s)\n81 Behavior: context-shock (CS) or shock-context (SC)\n82 Class: c-CS-s, c-CS-m, c-SC-s, c-SC-m, t-CS-s, t-CS-m, t-SC-s, t-SC-m\n\n\nRelevant Papers:\n\nThe posted data were analyzed by:\nHiguera C, Gardiner KJ, Cios KJ (2015) Self-Organizing Feature Maps Identify Proteins Critical to Learning in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome.

744	agriculture	Pesticide Data Program (2014)	# Context\n\nThis dataset contains information on pesticide residues in food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) conducts the Pesticide Data Program (PDP) every year to help assure consumers that the food they feed themselves and their families is safe. Ultimately, if EPA determines a pesticide is not safe for human consumption, it is removed from the market.\n\nThe PDP tests a wide variety of domestic and imported foods, with a strong focus on foods\nthat are consumed by infants and children. EPA relies on PDP data to conduct dietary risk\nassessments and to ensure that any pesticide residues in foods remain at safe levels. USDA\nuses the data to better understand the relationship of pesticide residues to agricultural practices\nand to enhance USDA’s Integrated Pest Management objectives. USDA also works with U.S.\ngrowers to improve agricultural practices.\n\n# Content\n\nWhile the original 2014 MS Access database can be found [here](https://www.ams.usda.gov/datasets/pdp/pdpdata), the data has been transferred to a SQLite database for easier, more open use. The database contains two tables, Sample Data and Results Data. Each sampling includes attributes such as extraction method, the laboratory responsible for the test, and EPA tolerances among others. These attributes are labeled with codes, which can be referenced in PDF format [here](https://www.ams.usda.gov/datasets/pdp/pdpdata), or integrated into the database using the included csv files. \n\n# Inspiration\n\n* What are the most common types of pesticides tested in this study?\n* Do certain states tend to use one particular pesticide type over another?\n* Does pesticide type correspond more with crop type or location (state)?\n* Are any produce types found to have higher pesticide levels than assumed safe by EPA standards?\n* By combining databases from several years of PDP tests, can you see any trends in pesticide use?\n\n# Acknowledgement\n\nThis dataset is part of the USDA PDP yearly database, and the original source can be found [here](https://www.ams.usda.gov/datasets/pdp/pdpdata).	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/usdeptofag/pesticide-data-program-2014	{business}	{unknown}	{"Annotate Code","Annotated Information","Claim Code","Commodity Marketing Claim","Commodity Code","Commodity Name","# of Samples Analyzed","Commod Type Code","Commodity Type","Concen/LOD Unit Code","Concen/LOD Unit Description","ConfMethod Code","Confirmation Method","Country Code","Country Name","Determin Code","Determinative Method","DistType Code","Collection Facility Type","Extract Code","Extraction Method","Lab Code","Lab Agency Name","Lab City/State","Mean Code","Mean Result Finding","Origin Code","Origin of Sample","Pest Code","Pesticide Name","Test Class","# of Analysis Results","Quantitate Code","Quantitation Method","State Code",State,"Test Class Code","Test (Compound) Class","Pesticide Code","EPA Tolerance Value",pp_,Note,Comment}	7156	44	41210	11830	0.5882352941176471

746	agriculture	Power consumption in India(2019-2020)	### Context\n\nIndia is the world's third-largest producer and third-largest consumer of electricity. The national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 370.106 GW as of 31 March 2020. Renewable power plants, which also include large hydroelectric plants, constitute 35.86% of India's total installed capacity. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the gross electricity generated by utilities in India was 1,372 TWh and the total electricity generation (utilities and non-utilities) in the country was 1,547 TWh. The gross electricity consumption in 2018-19 was 1,181 kWh per capita. \nIn 2015-16, electric energy consumption in agriculture was recorded as being the highest (17.89%) worldwide. The per capita electricity consumption is low compared to most other countries despite India having a low electricity tariff.\n\nIn light of the recent COVID-19 situation, when everyone has been under lockdown for the months of April & May the impacts of the lockdown on economic activities have been faced by every sector in a positive or a negative way. \nWith the electricity consumption being so crucial to the country, we came up with a plan to study the impact on energy consumption state and region wise.\n\nThe dataset is exhaustive in its demonstration of energy consumption state wise.\n\n### Content\nData is in the form of a time series for a period of 17 months beginning from 2nd Jan 2019 till 23rd May 2020. \nRows are indexed with dates and columns represent states. \nRows and columns put together, each datapoint reflects the power consumed in Mega Units (MU) by the given state (column) at the given date (row).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nPower System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) is a wholly-owned Government of India enterprise under the Ministry of Power. It was earlier a wholly-owned subsidiary of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. It was formed in March 2009 to handle the power management functions of PGCIL.\n\nThe dataset has been scraped from the weekly energy reports of POSOCO.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nExtensive research on power usage in the country is what inspired us to compile the dataset. We are making it public along with our research of the same. This is our first step towards independent data-based research. We are open to suggestions, compliments and criticism alike. \n\n### Do leave an upvote if you found the dataset helpful.

806	chemistry	Multi-label Classification of enzyme substrates	## Background\n\nEnzymes are known to act on molecules with structural similarities with their substrates. This behaviour is called promiscuity. Scientists working in drug discovery use this behaviour to target/design drugs to either block or promote biological actions. But, correct prediction of EC class(s) of substrates associated with enzymes has been a challenge in biology. Since there is no shortage of data, ML techniques can be employed to solve the aforementioned problem.\n\n### Points to keep in mind\n1. Substrate molecules can belong to multiple EC-Classes at the same time as same molecules participate in different types of reactions in biology\n2. Dataset is highly imbalanced in labels\n - Need an algorithm that can tackle label imbalance\n - Smallest label count is 1 and highest label count is 248\n\n### Content\nThere are 3 files names

752	agriculture	The National Summary of Meats	Beef. Lamb. Veal. We might not all eat them, but they are the meats whose grades the US Department of Agriculture has seen fit to publish. This dataset contains records on meat production and quality as far back as 1930. \n\nAfter meat and poultry are inspected for wholesomeness, producers and processors may request that they have products graded for quality by a licensed Federal grader. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (http://www.ams.usda.gov) is the agency responsible for grading meat and poultry. Those who request grading must pay for the service. Grading for quality means the evaluation of traits related to tenderness, juiciness, and flavor of meat; and, for poultry, a normal shape that is fully fleshed and meaty and free of defects.\n\nUSDA grades are based on nationally uniform Federal standards of quality. No matter where or when a consumer purchases graded meat or poultry, it must have met the same grade criteria. The grade is stamped on the carcass or side of beef and is usually not visible on retail cuts. However, retail packages of beef, as well as poultry, will show the U.S. grade mark if they have been officially graded.\n\nTo better understand the available fields:\n - All fields labeled 'pounds' are really in units of indicate millions\n   of pounds.\n - You can find a helpful explanation of what the different grades mean\n   [here][1].\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis data was kindly released by the US Department of Agriculture. You can find [their most recent meat updates here][2].\n\n### Inspiration\n\n - This is a good dataset for anyone looking to do basic data cleanup. I've converted it into a properly formed CSV, but there are still numerous missing values, footnoted fields, and exceptions.\n - This is a good candidate for regression analysis, especially in conjunction with other datasets. Can you identify correlates for the amount of beef produced? Validate how well cattle futures predict annual yields?\n - 2015 was a banner year for beef production. What happened?\n\n  [1]: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/production-and-inspection/inspection-and-grading-of-meat-and-poultry-what-are-the-differences_/inspection-and-grading-differences/!ut/p/a1/jZFRT4MwEMc_DY9di8yF-UZIzIYOXBYd42Xp4FpIoCVtkcxPb8EHnRm69qV39_tf2__hDKc4E_S94tRUUtB6iLPFkWzJwl2GJEqW7iNZx2_b5CkMib-7t8DhDyD2btRPrID8p49uuOBObcINx1lLTYkqwSROORhEhe5BaZwyKQukKQNzRozmBukSwNhCq2TR5YMVFi6sVLcwhjj9Po8lrmhRCY4kQw1QM-Za2dVGnVFfDgkFyJSAiooxUCBy0MfJLj8gvMfZ5ReJa_c69nbzVRR7JJn_Bq7M4AuYNtm6yGt5Ggd-CMTJ861dCoZHqFmnbLo0ptUPDnFI3_czLiWvYZbLxiHXJKXUBqeXJG6b1_TjOViR6qXZ-zr4BEpuht4!/#4a\n  [2]: http://usda.gov/content/usda-open-data-catalog	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/usda/the-national-summary-of-meats	{business,government,agriculture}	{other}	{YEAR,"POUNDS GRADED",PRIME,%,CHOICE,%.1,SELECT,%.2,STNDRD,%.3,COMRCL,%.4,UTILITY,%.5,CUTTER,%.6,CANNER,%.7,S/H,"%  of FEDERAL  SLAUGHTER\t BEEF",Y1,%.8,Y2,%.9,Y3,%.10,Y4,%.11,Y5,%.12,GOOD,CULL,"% OF FEDERAL  SLAUGHTER LAMB",FOOTNOTES,STAND'D,"% OF FEDERAL  SLAUGHTER VEAL & CALF"}	322	70	7780	4397	0.7058823529411765
753	agriculture	Water Quality Data [Telangana Groundwater]	**Context**\n\nWater is essential for all the crops and livestocks as much as it is important for human beings. Crops and livestocks consume direct ground water, and if the quality is not up to the mark, or becomes unusable, then crops and livestocks are affected, which may lead to crop failure or livestocks developing diseases. \nBy knowing the quality of the ground water, whether usable or not, the water can be put to appropriate use. Farmers can grow specific crops which can tolerate that quality of water.\n\n**Usage**\n\nBy using these datasets one can train an ML Classification model to classify the water quality into one of the multiple classes and know where and how the water can be used.\n\n**Data collected**\n\nThis data is collected from Telangana Open Data portal, Telangana State, India.\nThis data contains samples tested from various districts.\n\nThere are 3 files, each or year 2018, 2019 and 2020 contains post-monsoon season groundwater quality details.\nground_water_quality_2018_post.csv, \nground_water_quality_2019_post.csv,\nground_water_quality_2020_post.csv can be combinedly used.\n\n\nEach dataset contains 26 columns such as:\nserial num (sno), District, Mandal, Village, Lattitude, Longitude, Chemicals (such as Ca, Mg, CO3 etc), Total Hardness of the water, Total dissolved solids, RSC, SAR, and the target variables 'Classification' and 'Classification1'. \nThe feature columns can be used to predict water quality which are broadly classified into 9 classes, which are: C3S1, C2S1, C4S1,C4S2 , C3S2 ,C4S4 ,C3S3 ,C4S3, C1S1.\n\n**C1S1**: Low salinity and low sodium waters are good for irrigation and can be used with \nmost crops with no restriction on use on most of the soils.\n\n**C2S1**: Medium salinity and low sodium waters are good for irrigation and can be used on \nall most all soils with little danger of development of harmful levels of exchangeable \nsodium if a moderate amount of leaching occurs. Crops can be grown without any special \nconsideration for salinity control.\n\n**C3S1**: The high salinity and low sodium waters require good drainage. Crops with good \nsalt tolerance should be selected.\n\n**C3S2**: The high salinity and medium sodium waters require good drainage and can be used \non coarse - textured or organic soils having good permeability.\n\n**C3S3**: These high salinity and high sodium waters require special soil management, good \ndrainage, high leaching and organic matter additions. Gypsum amendments make feasible \nthe use of these waters.\n\n**C4S1**: Very high salinity and low sodium waters are not suitable for irrigation unless the \nsoil must be permeable and drainage must be adequate. Irrigation waters must be applied \nin excess to provide considerable leaching. Salt tolerant crops must be selected. \n\n**C4S2**: Very high salinity and medium sodium waters are not suitable for irrigation on fine \ntextured soils and low leaching conditions and can be used for irrigation on coarse textured \nor organic soils having good permeability. \n\n**C4S3**: Very high salinity and high sodium waters produce harmful levels of exchangeable \nsodium in most soils and will require special soil management, good drainage, high \nleaching, and organic matter additions. The Gypsum amendment makes feasible the use of \nthese waters. \n\n**C4S4**: Very high salinity and very high sodium waters are generally unsuitable for \nirrigation purposes. These are sodium chloride types of water and can cause sodium \nhazards. It can be used on coarse-textured soils with very good drainage for very high salt tolerant crops. Gypsum amendments make feasible the use of these waters.\n\n**Classification of groundwater based on RSC**\n\nRSC is defined as the excess of carbonate and bicarbonate amount over the alkaline \nearths (Ca2+ and Mg2+). Use of RSC beyond permissible limit (&gt;2.5) adversely affects irrigation. \nThe tendency of Ca2+ and Mg2+ to precipitate, as the water in the soil becomes more \nconcentrated, as a result of evaporation and plant transpiration, and gets fixed in the soil by the \nprocess of base exchange, thereby decreasing the soil permeability. \nRSC = ((CO3 2-) + (HCO3-)) - ((Ca2+)+(Mg2+))\nWhere concentrations are in meq/L.\n\nRSC less than 1.25 is **safe**\nRSC between 1.25 and 2.50 is **marginal**\nRSC greater than 2.50 is **unsuitable**\n\n**Use of ground water for livestock and poultry**\n\nTDS &lt; 1000 mg/L -- Excellent -- Excellent for all classes of livestock and poultry.\n\nTDS b/w 1000-3000 -- very satisfactory -- Satisfactory for all classes of livestock. May cause temporary mild diarrhea in livestock not accustomed to them. Those waters approaching the upper limits may cause some watery droppings in poultry.\n\nTDS b/w 3000-5000 -- Satisfactory for livestock Unfit for poultry -- Satisfactory for livestock but may be refused by animals not accustomed to it. If Sulphate salts predominate, animals may show temporary diarrhea. Poor waters for poultry, often causing watery faeces, increased mortality and decreasedgrowth especially in turkeys. \n\nTDS b/w 5000-7000 -- Limited use for livestock Unfit for poultry -- This water can be used for livestock except for those that are pregnant or lactating. It may have some laxative effect and may be refused by animals until they become accustomed to it. It is unsatisfactory for poultry.\n\nTDS b/w 7000-10,000 -- Very limited use -- Considerable risk for pregnant and lactating cows, horses, sheep and for the young of these species. It may be used for older ruminants or horses. Unfit for poultry and probably swine.\n\nTDS &gt; 10,000 -- Not recommended -- This water is unsatisfactory for all classes of livestock and poultry.\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/sivapriyagarladinne/telangana-post-monsoon-ground-water-quality-data	{"water bodies","earth and nature","earth science",chemistry,business,education,agriculture,"computer science",python}	{CC0-1.0}	{sno,district,mandal,village,lat_gis,long_gis,gwl,season,pH,E.C,TDS,CO3,HCO3,Cl,F,"NO3 ",SO4,Na,K,Ca,Mg,T.H,SAR,Classification,"RSC  meq  / L",Classification.1,EC,"CO_-2 ","HCO_ - ","Cl -","F -","NO3- ",SO4-2,Na+,K+,Ca+2,Mg+2,"Unnamed: 8"}	1106	79	29124	539	1

842	chemistry	US Core Samples	This is a dataset of core samples the United States Geological Survey maintains. Most of the samples housed at the USGS facility were drilled for the purpose of oil and gas exploration but others were drilled for research purposes like mineral or water exploration.\n\nSources of samples include state and USGS records, private donations, and samples gathered as part of the publication.\n\nThe Core Research Center is home to 9,800 rock cores and 53,000 cuttings wells that since 1974 has supplied valuable scientific information to academia, government agencies, and industry alike.  The majority of research conducted on the collection to date has been related to natural resource characterization, but the collection has also been studied for many other lines of inquiry. Some examples of past research include:\n-  A core drilled from Cajon Pass, CA which was drilled to determine fault motions and resistance to plate motion from two plates along an important fault.  \n- Cores from the Enewetak Atoll were originally used to understand the effects of nuclear bursts on geologic structures but have more recently been used in climate studies.  \n- Cores that were drilled in Yellowstone from a 1967-1968 expedition are still being researched to understand the chemistry of the rocks and the interactions with the geothermal fluids of Yellowstone.  \n- Cores from the Green River Formation have been used to understand ancient lake systems and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.  \n- The Castle Pines and Kiowa cores have been used to examine spatial variation on yields for groundwater resources in the Denver Basin and to study the paleobiology of the Upper Cretaceous and Lower Tertiary of the Denver Basin. \n\nThese are but a few examples of how these valuable resources can continue to contribute to our understanding of earth systems.\n\n### Some of these the Column names I don't get. What are they?\nColumns 0-5 pertain to the [Public Land Survey System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System) which was created in 1785 to plat and divide newly obtained land in the Americas.

758	chemistry	All Weed Seeds and Strains Dataset	The plant is also known as hemp, although this term is often used to refer only to varieties of Cannabis cultivated for non-drug use. Cannabis has long been used for hemp fibre, hemp seeds and their oils, hemp leaves for use as vegetables and as juice, medicinal purposes, and as a recreational drug. Industrial hemp products are made from cannabis plants selected to produce an abundance of fiber. To satisfy the UN Narcotics Convention, some cannabis strains have been bred to produce minimal levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent. Some strains have been selectively bred to produce a maximum of THC (a cannabinoid), the strength of which is enhanced by curing the fruits. Various compounds, including hashish and hash oil, are extracted from the plant.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/psycon/weed-seeds-dataset	{"mental health",healthcare,"public health",chemistry,health}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Unnamed: 0",name,img_url,description,type,thc_level,most_common_terpene,relaxed,happy,euphoric,uplifted,sleepy,dry_mouth,dry_eyes,dizzy,paranoid,anxious,stress,pain,depression,anxiety,insomnia,hungry,talkative,headache,ptsd,creative,energetic,fatigue,focused,giggly,lack_of_appetite,nausea,headaches,bipolar_disorder,cancer,tingly,cramps,aroused,gastrointestinal_disorder,inflammation,muscle_spasms,eye_pressure,migraines,asthma,anorexia,arthritis,add/adhd,muscular_dystrophy,hypertension,glaucoma,pms,seizures,spasticity,spinal_cord_injury,fibromyalgia,crohns_disease,phantom_limb_pain,epilepsy,multiple_sclerosis,parkinsons,tourettes_syndrome,alzheimers,hiv/aids,tinnitus}	9524	67	319054	9696	1

760	chemistry	Amino Acid Replacement Datasets	This dataset contains 3 symmetrical matrices of  physicochemical distances taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid_replacement). Physicochemical distance is a measure that assesses the difference between replaced amino acids. The value of distance is based on properties of amino acids. There are 134 physicochemical properties that can be used to estimate similarity between amino acids. Each physicochemical distance is based on different composition of properties.\n\nEach row and column in all the tables from this dataset represent amino acids (designated by their letters) and each cell has the distance coefficient for every pair combination.\n\n### Epstein coefficient of difference\n\nEpstein's coefficient of difference is based on the differences in polarity and size between replaced pairs of amino acids. This index that distincts the direction of exchange between amino acids, described by 2 equations.\n\n### Grantham distance\n\nGrantham's distance depends on three properties: composition, polarity and molecular volume.\n\n### Sneath index\n\nSneath's index takes into account 134 categories of activity and structure. Dissimilarity index D is a percentage value of the sum of all properties not shared between two replaced amino acids. It is percentage value expressed by D=1-S, where S is Similarity.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/alejopaullier/amino-acid-replacement-datasets	{genetics,biology,chemistry,biotechnology,tabular}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Unnamed: 0",F,M,L,I,V,P,Y,W,C,A,G,S,T,H,E,Q,D,N,K,R}	60	63	1260	0	0.8823529411764706

762	chemistry	 A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners Dataset	# Content\n\nThe Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?\n\nWell, we're going to find out! The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016.

DFT is the most successful method calculates atomic coordinates faster than other mathematical approaches, and it also reaches more accurate results. The dataset is generated with CASTEP using CNT geometry optimization. Many CNTs are simulated in CASTEP, then geometry optimizations are calculated. Initial coordinates of all carbon atoms are generated randomly. Different chiral vectors are used for each CNT simulation. The atom type is selected as carbon, bond length is used as 1.42 AÂ° (default value). CNT calculation parameters are used as default parameters. To finalize the computation, CASTEP uses a parameter named as elec_energy_tol (electrical energy tolerance) (default 1x10-5 eV) which represents that the change in the total energy from one iteration to the next remains below some tolerance value per atom for a few self-consistent field steps. Initial atomic coordinates (u, v, w), chiral vector (n, m) and calculated atomic coordinates (uâ€™, vâ€™, wâ€™) are obtained from the output files.\nAttribute Information:\nChiral indice n: n parameter of the selected chiral vector.\nChiral indice m: n parameter of the selected chiral vector.\nInitial atomic coordinate u: Randomly generated u parameter of the initial atomic coordinates of all carbon atoms.\nInitial atomic coordinate v: Randomly generated v parameter of the initial atomic coordinates of all carbon atoms.\nInitial atomic coordinate w: Randomly generated w parameter of the initial atomic coordinates of all carbon atoms.\nCalculated atomic coordinate uâ€™: Calculated uâ€™ parameter of the atomic coordinates of all carbon atoms.\nCalculated atomic coordinate vâ€™: Calculated vâ€™ parameter of the atomic coordinates of all carbon atoms.\nCalculated atomic coordinate wâ€™: Calculated wâ€™ parameter of the atomic coordinates of all carbon atoms.\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/aayushkandpal/carbon-naonotubes	{research,"earth and nature",chemistry,physics,"artificial intelligence",regression}	{unknown}	{"Chiral indice n;Chiral indice m;Initial atomic coordinate u;Initial atomic coordinate v;Initial atomic coordinate w;Calculated atomic coordinates u';Calculated atomic coordinates v';Calculated atomic coordinates w'"}	10721	1	10721	21	0.5294117647058824

774	chemistry	Comprehensive database of Minerals	This dataset is the collection of 3112 minerals, their chemical compositions, crystal structure, physical and optical properties. The properties that are included in this database are the Crystal structure, Mohs Hardness, Refractive Index, Optical axes, Optical Dispersion, Molar Volume, Molar, Mass, Specific Gravity, and Calculated Density.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe term ‘dielectric’ is applied to a class of materials - usually solids - that are poor conductors of\nelectricity. Dielectrics are of significant technological and industrial importance, being essential\nfunctional components of almost all electronic devices. For most of these applications, they are\nrequired to be mechanically tough and thermally robust. The defining physical attribute of a\ndielectric is electric polarizability which is the tendency for charges to be non-uniformly\ndistributed across a chemical bond. Most dielectrics contain dipoles due to their ionic bonds or\ncovalent bonds with strong ionic nature. At a macroscopic scale, this implies that an external\nelectric field can interact with these charges and result in various optical and electric phenomena.\n\nOptically, dielectrics can be transparent, opaque, or vitreous. They can also be isotropic, \nbiaxial, or fully anisotropic. The luster of gem minerals such as emerald, sapphire, and ruby is due to\ntheir high refractive index which causes white light to be split into its components. The presence\nof two refractive indices in a material can result in an incident beam being split into two rays\nthat interfere with each other. This common phenomenon is called Birefringence. These effects\nare made use of in many commercially important applications such as transparent conductive\noxides, liquid crystal displays, medical diagnostics, stress sensing, light modulation, etc.\nAs an example, transparent conducting oxides (TCO) are derived from dielectrics by doping oxides\nwith impurity atoms. TCOs do not absorb light in the visible spectrum rendering them transparent\nand are also conductors of charge. The most important application of TCOs is as the top\nelectrode of solar cells where they allow light to fall on a semiconducting layer while capturing\nthe released hole/electron to generate current. Airplane windshields have a thin coating of a\nTCO material on them that is used to generate heat by passing a current. This is necessary to\nkeep the glass defrosted allowing the pilot visibility to navigate. Other applications of TCOs is\nas substrates in electronics, flexible displays, high definition TVs, and the screens of mobile smart\ndevices.\n\nThe figure for merit for optical phenomena is the refractive index, which is defined as the ratio\nof the speed of light in the medium to the speed of light in vavacuum.\n\n**Provenance of Data**\n\nThe list of minerals with individual pages in Wikipedia is given at:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minerals. The ‘get’ method of the requests library is used\nto retrieve this page and the content is parsed using BeautifulSoup – a python library specifically\nengineered for parsing html and lxml content. The URLs for all the minerals given in this page is\nextracted using their ‘href’ attribute and are stored in a dictionary, along with the mineral name.\nEach of the webpages has textual information on the mineral (origin, etymology, variety, history\netc.), images (cleavages, and other data) as well as an ‘Infobox’ on the right that tabulates some\ncommon mineral properties such as category, formula, strunz classification, crystal structure,\nunit cell, Mohs hardness, color, cleavage, fracture, luster, diaphaneity, specific gravity, optical\nproperties a and refractive index. The soup object for the page is retrieved and the ‘table’ element\nwith class name ‘infobox’ is extracted. The specified row heading and row data are then read into\na dictionary which is wrapped in a class object. A class method writes this data into a csv file while\nanother method writes the text from the webpage into a text file. \n\nThe American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database at\nhttp://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/amcsd.php has a list of over 4000 minerals with their cif files.\nThe name and the URL of all these minerals are found at http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS. From\nhere, each mineral name and the corresponding URL is extracted using the approach outlined\nabove. Accessing each page, we find the crystallographic information of the mineral. The a,b,c edge\nlengths and alpha, beta, gamma - unit cell angles are given at the top followed by a list of\nall atoms and their x,y,z positions. The header is extracted and stored in a pandas dataframe\nwhile the atomic species and their positions are saved into a separate CSV file. This is repeated\nfor all the 4000 minerals. Before inclusion into the machine learning stage of this study, each of these \\\ncif files are read and parsed into a vector with each cell corresponding to an element of the periodic table and the number\nof atoms of the element in the formula is counted as the cell value. This is detailed further in\nthe data processing part of the project.\n\nCompared to other properties, dispersion of minerals has been hard to find. Dispersion values of\n60 minerals found at: http://gemologyproject.com/wiki.\n\nThe chemical formula, molar mass, molar volume, and calculated density are available for all minerals. The availability of other properties vary.\n\n**Chemical Formula**\n\nThe chemical formula has been parsed so that the number of each element has been separated tabulated. For example, the mineral Quartz has the formula 'SiO2' - so that the corresponding entry for the column 'Silicon' is 1 and the entry for 'Oxygen' is 2. The entries for all the other elements are 0.\n\nIn this way, the chemical formula for each mineral is converted into a vector where each column corresponds to an element in the periodic table and the value corresponds to the number of atoms of the element in a formula unit of the mineral.\n\nIn addition to the pure elements, ionic species such as carbonate, phosphate, nitrate, cyanide, hydrated water, etc are also counted separately.\n\n**Molar Mass**\n\nThe molar mass of the mineral is calculated by adding together the mass of each atom in a mole of the mineral.\n\nMolar mass = Summation( no of atoms * mass of each atom)\n\n**Molar Volume**\n\nThe molar volume of the mineral is calculated by adding together the volume of each atom in a mole of the mineral.\n\nMolar volume = Summation( no of atoms * volume of each atom)\n\n**Refractive Index**\n\nThe refractive index of the mineral is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in the mineral to the speed of light in free space.\n\nThis is a function of the frequency of light. The RI of blue light is not the same as the RI of red light in the same mineral. This variation is measured by 'dispersion'.\n\n**Mohs Hardness**\n\nMohs hardness is a qualitative measure for the hardness of a mineral that is frequently used by\nthe geologist. Diamond (hardest mineral) is given the highest value of 10 and talc (softest\nmineral) is given the value of 1. A mineral that can scratch a second mineral has a higher Mohs\nhardness. In this way, all the minerals can be ranked on a relative scale of hardness. It is not exactly clear what physical parameter is represented by the Mohs Hardness. Several absolute scales for hardness such as toughness, yield strength, etc. are known from the mechanics of materials, however, none of them seem to correspond exactly to Mohs Hardness. However, this remains a very intuitive way to understand the physical property of a material.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/vinven7/comprehensive-database-of-minerals	{"earth and nature",geology,chemistry,"computer science"}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Unnamed: 0",Name,"Crystal Structure","Mohs Hardness",Diaphaneity,"Specific Gravity",Optical,"Refractive Index",Dispersion,Hydrogen,Helium,Lithium,Beryllium,Boron,Carbon,Nitrogen,Oxygen,Fluorine,Neon,Sodium,Magnesium,Aluminium,Silicon,Phosphorus,Sulfur,Chlorine,Argon,Potassium,Calcium,Scandium,Titanium,Vanadium,Chromium,Manganese,Iron,Cobalt,Nickel,Copper,Zinc,Gallium,Germanium,Arsenic,Selenium,Bromine,Krypton,Rubidium,Strontium,Yttrium,Zirconium,Niobium,Molybdenum,Technetium,Ruthenium,Rhodium,Palladium,Silver,Cadmium,Indium,Tin,Antimony,Tellurium,Iodine,Xenon,Cesium,Barium,Lanthanum,Cerium,Praseodymium,Neodymium,Promethium,Samarium,Europium,Gadolinium,Terbium,Dysprosium,Holmium,Erbium,Thulium,Ytterbium,Lutetium,Hafnium,Tantalum,Tungsten,Rhenium,Osmium,Iridium,Platinum,Gold,Mercury,Thallium,Lead,Bismuth,Polonium,Astatine,Radon,Francium,Radium,Actinium,Thorium,Protactinium,Uranium,Neptunium,Plutonium,Americium,Curium,Berkelium,Californium,Einsteinium,Fermium,Mendelevium,Nobelium,Lawrencium,Rutherfordium,Dubnium,Seaborgium,Bohrium,Hassium,Meitnerium,Darmstadtium,Roentgenium,Copernicium,Nihonium,Flerovium,Moscovium,Livermorium,Tennessine,Oganesson,Cyanide,Nitrate,Hydroxyl,Acetate,Phosphate,Sulphate,Carbonate,Ammonium,"Hydrated Water",count,"Molar Mass","Molar Volume","Calculated Density"}	3112	140	435680	0	1
775	chemistry	Compressive Strength of Concrete	# Context\nCivil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.\n\nConcrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce the size, as opposed to which withstands loads tending to elongate. In other words, compressive strength resists being pushed together, whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled apart). In the study of strength of materials, tensile strength, compressive strength, and shear strength can be analyzed independently.\n\n# Objective\nThe concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate. Your objective is to build a machine learning model that would help Civil Engineers to estimate the compressive strength of the concrete and they can further take a decision whether the concrete should be used in their current project or not.\n\n# Data Description\nCement (component 1)(kg in a m3 mixture): Cement   (component 1) -- Kilogram in a meter-cube mixture -- Input Variable\nBlast Furnace Slag (component 2)(kg in a m3 mixture): Blast Furnace   Slag (component 2) -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable\nFly Ash (component 3)(kg in a m3 mixture): Fly Ash   (component 3) -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable\nWater  (component 4)(kg in a m3   mixture): Water   (component 4) -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable\nSuperplasticizer (component 5)(kg in a m3 mixture): Superplasticizer   (component 5) -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable\nCoarse Aggregate  (component 6)(kg   in a m3 mixture): Coarse   Aggregate (component 6) -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable\nFine Aggregate (component 7)(kg in a m3 mixture): Fine Aggregate   (component 7) -- kg in a m3 mixture -- Input Variable\nAge (day): Age -- Day   (1-365) -- Input Variable\nConcrete compressive strength(MPa, megapascals): Concrete   compressive strength -- MegaPascals -- Output Variable	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/compressive-strength-of-concrete	{chemistry,"science and technology"}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Cement (component 1)(kg in a m^3 mixture)","Blast Furnace Slag (component 2)(kg in a m^3 mixture)","Fly Ash (component 3)(kg in a m^3 mixture)","Water  (component 4)(kg in a m^3 mixture)","Superplasticizer (component 5)(kg in a m^3 mixture)","Coarse Aggregate  (component 6)(kg in a m^3 mixture)","Fine Aggregate (component 7)(kg in a m^3 mixture)","Age (day)","Concrete compressive strength(MPa, megapascals) "}	1030	17	9012	0	0.7058823529411765
776	chemistry	Concrete mix design and strength 	The background to this dataset is twofold: 1) I hold a PhD in cement and concrete science, hence, got a deep interest in concrete mix designs, their optimal formulation and ultimately, reducing the cement content to decrease the carbon emissions. \n\n2) There is a growing interest in applying machine learning in concrete science. The biggest blocker is data availability. Unfortunately, the industry is not that data-savvy yet, and has no effective mechanism of collecting concrete mix design data from construction sites. The largest dataset I managed to compile contains about 2500 rows (I know!) \n\nHowever, the opportunity is massive. I suggest you have a quick read through this paper - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00810-x\n\nFeel free to send me a DM to discuss in more detail. I am open to collaborations with any professional who might share a similar interest. \n\nIt will be massively helpful if we can get a better understanding of the relationship between the admixtures, cement volume and compressive strength.\n\nIf someone can help me with slicing the "Additive_Type_&_Dosage_(/100_kg_of_cement)" column into 1) type of additive and 2) dosage volume that would be much appreciated. 	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/dimitar0dimov/concrete-mix-design-and-strength	{chemistry,"science and technology",engineering,intermediate}	{unknown}	{"Unnamed: 0",Type_of_course_Aggregate,Type_of_Fine_Aggregate_,Max._Size_of_Coarse_Aggregate_(mm),Passing_0.6_mm_Sieve_(%),Target_Mean_Strength_(N/mm2),Cement_O.P.C_(Kg/m3),W/C_Ratio,Water_Content_(Kg/m3),Additive_Type_&_Dosage_(/100_kg_of_cement),Total_Aggregate_(Kg/m3),Fine_Aggregate_(Kg/m3),Coarse_Aggregate_(Kg/m3),Workability_Slump_(mm),Hardened_Concrete_Desnity_(avg.),7_day_str,28_day_str,Type_of_Coarse_Aggregate,Type_of_Fine_Aggregate,Passing_0.6mm_Sieve(%),Additive_Type_&_Dos._(/100_Kg_of_cement),Admix_type,Admix_dosage}	2286	23	52578	2748	0.7647058823529411

779	chemistry	Crystal-Structures	There have been numerous studies of perovskite structures in the field of ceramic science and engineering, materials physics, and solid-state inorganic chemistry owing to their compositional flexibility, distortion of the cation configuration, and mixed valence state electronic structure. \n\nThis has prompted scientists to tune the material’s properties so as to obtain a much more ideal perovskite structure. An ideal perovskite has an ABX3 structure where A and B are two differently sized cations, and X is an anion\n\nA total of 73 elements have been identified in the A and B sites of ABO3 structures, leading to numerous oxides of the perovskite type. Features such as electronegativity, ionic radius, valence, and bond lengths of A-O and B-O pairs have been identified that enable a priori crystal structure prediction. 	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/sayansh001/crystal-structure-classification	{"earth and nature","earth science",geology,"multiclass classification"}	{CC0-1.0}	{Compound,A,B,"In literature",v(A),v(B),r(AXII)(Ã),r(AVI)(Ã),r(BVI)(Ã),EN(A),EN(B),l(A-O)(Ã),l(B-O)(Ã),ÎENR,tG,Ï,Î¼,"Lowest distortion"}	5329	18	95922	0	0.9705882352941176

843	chemistry	Vibrio vulnificus Abundance in Ala Wai Canal	_____\n# Vibrio vulnificus Abundance in Ala Wai Canal\n### Exploring Temporal, Spatial and Environmental Influences\nBy  [[source]](https://zenodo.org/record/6079124#.Y9Y8jtJBwUE)\n_____\n\n### About this dataset\n> This dataset provides researchers a vital tool to better understand the environmental influences of the human pathogen, Vibrio vulnificus, present in the tropical environment of Honolulu's Ala Wai Canal. With this data collected over a one-year period, researchers are now able to explore its variability and relationship with variables such as temperature, salinity, reduced nitrogen species and silica concentrations. This data set seeks to further clarify how environmental components can dictate the distribution and abundance of V. vulnificus and other pathogenic bacterial species, bridging the gap between ecological understanding and public health risk prevention measures. Through linking these components together from different regions around world that harbor this dangerous human pathogen – from coastal estuaries in Hawaii to oyster beds found in Florida – we can make more informed predictions about water quality standards for safe swimming and fishing practices alike. By innovating new ways to look at bacteria-environment interactions on an unprecedented scale for multiple vibrios at once, we edge ever closer towards a more complete comprehension of Vibrio ecology across various aquatic ecosystems worldwide\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset provides researchers the opportunity to explore the relationship between environmental variables and Vibrio vulnificus abundance in Honolulu’s Ala Wai Canal. This data can be used to help better understand the distribution of this human pathogen as well as for predicting and managing public health risk.\n> \n> To use this dataset, you can begin by exploring simple relationships between variables in your research question. To do this, try using a subset of data from a particular time span that would answer your research question and implement your desired model. Furthermore, it may be beneficial to use statistical methods such as correlation or regression models in order to determine the strength of these relationships and test their significance using p-values or other significances tests such as ANOVA/chi-square tests.  \n> \n> To use all of the data provided, you may also want implement more advanced analysis techniques such as decision tree algorithms or generalized linear modeling (GLM) techniques which could help identify complex multi-variable relationships between environment and Vibrio vulnificus abundance that were not necessarily seen with simpler analysis approaches such as correlation or regression models. These methods will help you understand how various environmental parameters are influencing population dynamics over time.   \n> \n> Finally, this dataset can also give detailed insights into population structures by determining significant changes throughout seasons across all sites sampled over one year period by comparing monthly averages for variables in different locations/sites where Vibrio vulnificus was collected/sampled from using boxplots for further visualisations and descriptive statistics\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - It can be used to analyze the effectiveness of simulated prebiotic alterations in a local or regional ecosystem to reduce/limit the growth and spread of Vibrio vulnificus and other human pathogenic bacteria.\n> - It can be used to study temperature-dependent Vibrio vulnificus colonization patterns, allowing for predictive modeling and understanding of environments where rapid increases in temperature may lead to an increased risk for infection or water borne illness, as well as optimal strategies for preventing or minimizing exposure in such circumstances.\n> - It can be used by medical personnel and other healthcare workers to better recognize symptoms, determine treatments, and recommend preventive strategies related to Vibrio vulnificus infections based on environmental conditions prevailing at the time of exposure(s)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/6079124#.Y9Y8jtJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

783	chemistry	Dilute Solution Diffusion	### Context\n\nFor dilute solute diffusion can be used to predict an effective diffusion barrier for a solute element moving through another host element. The dataset has been calculated with DFT methods.\n\n### Content\n\nDilute Solute Diffusion:\n\n\tRelevant papers:\n\t\tOriginal paper describing dataset in detail [1]:\n\t\thttps://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201654\n\t\tPrevious machine learning results [2]:\n\t\thttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025617301738\n\t\n\tX features:\n\t\tThe solute diffusion data includes two “material composition” columns which\n\t\tdenote the elements used as the host and solute respectively. Material properties \n\t\thave been generated from these host and solute elements and are given in columns\n\t\tfour and onward. For example, the column "Site2_MeltingT" would be the solute \n\t\tmelting temperature for that host-solute pair. These properties have been generated \n\t\tusing the MAGPIE framework, and have been selected because they have been shown \n\t\tin previous ML work to give good results when predicting these diffusion energy\n\t\tbarriers [3].\n\t\t\n\tY property:\n\t\tThe material property this dataset seeks to predict is the effective diffusion\n\t\tactivation energy for vacancy mediated diffusion of a dilute solute element\n\t\tin a known host crystal. The reported energies have all been normalized to the\n\t\thost value such that each energy in a host-solute pair is the relative energy\n\t\tto the respective host's self diffusion value. For example Al-Al could have\n\t\tan absolute value of 0.5 eV, but this value is subtracted off to bring the\n\t\tvalue in the dataset to 0 eV. Then every datapoint with Al as the host has the\n\t\tsame adjustment made to it. If Al-Ag's absolute value is 0.7 eV, the reported\n\t\tvalue in the dataset is 0.2 eV (0.7 - 0.5). \n\t\t\n\t\tThere is also an alternative column with raw energy values instead of the normalized\n\t\tvalues. Using the raw values allows the particularly slow diffusers like W to be \n\t\tseparated out from the rest of the hosts.\n\t\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMorgan, Dane (2018): Machine Learning Materials Datasets. figshare.

784	chemistry	Dissolved inorganic nitrogen prediction	When doing estuary health assessments one of the first aspects to measure is the characteristics of the water. This requires one to do a nutrient analysis of the water. The process can be very laborious as the tests for nitrogen can be very time-consuming. If one doesn't have a mass spectrometer it's necessary to do acidic digestions and then use photometry to calculate absorbance. \n\nDoing to calculate dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) is not so laborious as only one digestion is required. However, to calculate dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to digestions is required for accurate results. One to calculate the ammonium, and another to calculate nitrogen oxides.\n\nSo I thought why not try and develop a machine learning model to predict DIN using two chemical properties and DIP. 	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/christostripodis/dissolved-inorganic-nitrogen-prediction	{environment,chemistry,regression}	{other}	{Region,Water_electrical_conductivity,Water_pH,Dissolved_inorganic_phosphorus,Dissolved_inorganic_nitrogen,"Unnamed: 5"}	727	6	4362	728	0.8823529411764706
785	chemistry	Distinct monomeric protein conformers	## Schema description:\nThe manually curated dataset of open-closed monomers is included here as `benchmarking_monomeric_open_closed_conformers.csv`.  \n\nColumn descriptions:\n\n## Schema description:\nThe manually curated dataset of open-closed monomers is included here as `benchmarking_monomeric_open_closed_conformers.csv`.  \n\nColumn descriptions:\n\n- **`UNP_ACC`** | UniProt accession code\n- **`UNP_START`** | Start of UniProt sequence for given PDBe entries\n- **`UNP_END`** | End of UniProt sequence for given PDBe entries\n- **`PDBe_ID`** | Protein Data Bank code\n- **`CHAIN_ID`**  | Author declared chain ID (`char`)\n- **`label_asym_id`** | Programmatically assigned chain ID (`char`)\n- **`CONFORMER_ID`** | Unique code for PDBe entries with distinct conformation, corresponding to a given UniProt accession\n- **`CONFORMER_DESCR`** | Short description of conformation, based on depositor's assessment of the protein/conformation\n- **`LIT_CONFIRMED`** | True/false value based on whether a publication (scientific literature) was available for manually curating clusters. NB: Clusters with 0 in this field should be used with caution. \n-  **`ALT_CONFORMER_ID`** | Where the publication for a structure is currently outstanding, an executive decision on the conformation classification is made. Where the literature is not explicit on the features of a given conformation, the second most suitable `CONFORMER_ID` is provided in this column. Blank cells have no other likely conformation assignmnt and are therefore the same as in `CONFORMER_ID`. \n- **`ALT_CONFORMER_DESCR`** | Description for conformation in alternative conformation ID. \n\n## Curation process\nAs of 09 Mar 2022, a manually curated dataset of monomeric protein conformations has been collated, containing 'open'-'closed' pairs as well as intermediary states defined by the authors of the entry. \n\n1. The PDBe was queried, through its Oracle DB, to find PDBe entries with 100 % sequence identity for a UniProt segment in both 'open' and 'closed' conformations, as stated in the entry's `TITLE` field. The query used: \n```\nselect b.accession, b.unp_start, b.unp_end, a.id, a.title, d.id, d.title\nfrom entry a, unp_entity b, unp_entity c, entry d, pdb_assembly e\nwhere a.title like ‘%open%’  and d.title like ‘%close%’\nand a.id = b.entry_id and d.id = c.entry_id and a.id != d.id\nand b.accession = c.accession\nand b.unp_start = c.unp_start\nand b.unp_end = c.unp_end\nand a.id = e.entry_id\nand e.type = ‘homo’\nand e.name = ‘monomer’\n```\nwas written by Dr Sameer Velankar. \n\n2. These results were cleaned to remove entries with 'open' or 'close' substrings in their `TITLE`  fields that did not refer to conformation. The 'open' substring often appeared in ligand names in the entries' `TITLE` field, such as in *dichlorido(1,3-dimethylbenzimidaz ol-2-ylidene)(eta5-pentamethylcycl**open**tadienyl)rhodium(III)* and 'close' in terms like *dis**close**s*.\n\n3. All remaining entries were then manually curated by investigating each PDBe entry's corresponding publication, where available.\n 1. Additional PDBe entries submitted by the authors, which were missed in the original search due to a lack of 'open' or 'close' substrings in their `TITLE` field but stated as fitting one of the states in the publication, were added.\n 2. For some UniProt accessions, intermediary conformations were reported by the authors and these were noted in the dataset under the `CONFORMER_DESCR` column. \n 3. Entries deposited in monomeric form but solved as a multimeric complex were also removed. \n\n4. PDBe entries, now clustered by author-stated conformation, were cross-referenced against the PDBe-KB's existing clustering algorithm (available on the [Aggregate Views of Proteins](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/protein) page) to assess current conformer clustering success. These results are currently awaiting publication. \n\n### Curation process outline\n<img src="http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pdbe-kb/benchmarking/distinct-monomer-conformers/work_progress_flowdiagram_200pc.png" alt="Curation flow diagram">\n\n### Dataset summary\n<img src="http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pdbe-kb/benchmarking/distinct-monomer-conformers/summary_data_visualisation.png" alt="Benchmark dataset summary graphs">\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/josephellaway/distinct-monomeric-protein-conformers	{categorical,biology,chemistry,biotechnology,tabular}	{CC-BY-SA-4.0}	{UNP_ACC,UNP_START,UNP_END,PDBe_ID,CHAIN_ID,CONFORMER_ID,CONFORMER_DESCR,LIT_CONFIRMED,NOTES,"Unnamed: 0",label_asym_id,ALT_CONFORMER_ID,ALT_CONFORMER_DESCR}	1096	33	12084	2216	0.8823529411764706

790	chemistry	fluorescent_protein_oligomeric_state	### Background\nMonomeric FPs are ideal tools for fluorescent tagging in biomedical imaging whereas oligomeric FPs hinder their usage as tagging labels because of their tendencies to aggregate. The prediction of oligomeric states is helpful for enhancing live biomedical imaging. Computational prediction of FP oligomeric states can accelerate the effort of protein engineering efforts of creating monomeric FPs. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first dataset for predicting and analyzing FP oligomerization directly from the amino acid sequence. Therefore, such data can be used for building classification models for classifying the FPs as being either in the monomeric or oligomeric states.\n\n### About the data set\nInitially, a data set consisting of 409 FPs along with their oligomeric states were compiled from the primary literature. Redundancy reduction of the sequence was performed using the CD–HIT algorithm [19] as implemented in the cdhitHR function of the BioSeqClass R package. Threshold values of 0.95, 0.99 and 1.00 (i.e. corresponding to 95%, 99% and 100%, respectively) was set using the identity argument to produce a reduced subset consisting of 136, 261 and 397 FPs, respectively.\n\nThus, after data curation an exhaustive data set consisting of 397 non-redundant FP oligomeric states was manually compiled from the literature. \n\nThe oligomeric state has 3 classes: 1) monomers, 2) dimers and 3) tetramers.\n\nModels that can be built from the dataset could potentially provide useful insights on the important residues governing the oligomerization of FP. For instance, what patterns are commonly found for the monomer class versus the oligomer class, etc.\n\n### Getting started\n\nInterested users of this dataset can:\n- use the ``AminoAcidSequence`` column to compute amino acid descriptors\n- use the ``OligomericState`` column as the class label. For the purpose of analysis and model building, users can group the ``dimers`` and ``tetramers`` together and rename them to belong to the same group of ``oligomer``.\n\n### Further information\n\nIf you would like further information, please read the full research article describing the use of this data set for predictive model building in the following research article:\n\n&gt; Simeon S, Shoombuatong W, Anuwongcharoen N, Preeyanon L, Prachayasittikul V, Wikberg JES, Nantasenamat C. osFP: a web server for predicting the oligomeric states of fluorescent proteins.

793	chemistry	Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Development	```\nReaven and Miller examined the relationship among blood chemistry measures of glucose tolerance and insulin in 145 nonobese adults. They used the PRIM9 system at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center to visualize the data in 3D, and discovered a peculiar pattern that looked like a large blob with two wings in different directions.\n\nAfter further analysis, the subjects were classified as subclinical (chemical) diabetics, overt diabetics and normals. This study was influential in defining the stages of development of Type 2 diabetes.

844	chemistry	Water Quality Data [Telangana Groundwater]	**Context**\n\nWater is essential for all the crops and livestocks as much as it is important for human beings. Crops and livestocks consume direct ground water, and if the quality is not up to the mark, or becomes unusable, then crops and livestocks are affected, which may lead to crop failure or livestocks developing diseases. \nBy knowing the quality of the ground water, whether usable or not, the water can be put to appropriate use. Farmers can grow specific crops which can tolerate that quality of water.\n\n**Usage**\n\nBy using these datasets one can train an ML Classification model to classify the water quality into one of the multiple classes and know where and how the water can be used.\n\n**Data collected**\n\nThis data is collected from Telangana Open Data portal, Telangana State, India.\nThis data contains samples tested from various districts.\n\nThere are 3 files, each or year 2018, 2019 and 2020 contains post-monsoon season groundwater quality details.\nground_water_quality_2018_post.csv, \nground_water_quality_2019_post.csv,\nground_water_quality_2020_post.csv can be combinedly used.\n\n\nEach dataset contains 26 columns such as:\nserial num (sno), District, Mandal, Village, Lattitude, Longitude, Chemicals (such as Ca, Mg, CO3 etc), Total Hardness of the water, Total dissolved solids, RSC, SAR, and the target variables 'Classification' and 'Classification1'. \nThe feature columns can be used to predict water quality which are broadly classified into 9 classes, which are: C3S1, C2S1, C4S1,C4S2 , C3S2 ,C4S4 ,C3S3 ,C4S3, C1S1.\n\n**C1S1**: Low salinity and low sodium waters are good for irrigation and can be used with \nmost crops with no restriction on use on most of the soils.\n\n**C2S1**: Medium salinity and low sodium waters are good for irrigation and can be used on \nall most all soils with little danger of development of harmful levels of exchangeable \nsodium if a moderate amount of leaching occurs. Crops can be grown without any special \nconsideration for salinity control.\n\n**C3S1**: The high salinity and low sodium waters require good drainage. Crops with good \nsalt tolerance should be selected.\n\n**C3S2**: The high salinity and medium sodium waters require good drainage and can be used \non coarse - textured or organic soils having good permeability.\n\n**C3S3**: These high salinity and high sodium waters require special soil management, good \ndrainage, high leaching and organic matter additions. Gypsum amendments make feasible \nthe use of these waters.\n\n**C4S1**: Very high salinity and low sodium waters are not suitable for irrigation unless the \nsoil must be permeable and drainage must be adequate. Irrigation waters must be applied \nin excess to provide considerable leaching. Salt tolerant crops must be selected. \n\n**C4S2**: Very high salinity and medium sodium waters are not suitable for irrigation on fine \ntextured soils and low leaching conditions and can be used for irrigation on coarse textured \nor organic soils having good permeability. \n\n**C4S3**: Very high salinity and high sodium waters produce harmful levels of exchangeable \nsodium in most soils and will require special soil management, good drainage, high \nleaching, and organic matter additions. The Gypsum amendment makes feasible the use of \nthese waters. \n\n**C4S4**: Very high salinity and very high sodium waters are generally unsuitable for \nirrigation purposes. These are sodium chloride types of water and can cause sodium \nhazards. It can be used on coarse-textured soils with very good drainage for very high salt tolerant crops. Gypsum amendments make feasible the use of these waters.\n\n**Classification of groundwater based on RSC**\n\nRSC is defined as the excess of carbonate and bicarbonate amount over the alkaline \nearths (Ca2+ and Mg2+). Use of RSC beyond permissible limit (&gt;2.5) adversely affects irrigation. \nThe tendency of Ca2+ and Mg2+ to precipitate, as the water in the soil becomes more \nconcentrated, as a result of evaporation and plant transpiration, and gets fixed in the soil by the \nprocess of base exchange, thereby decreasing the soil permeability. \nRSC = ((CO3 2-) + (HCO3-)) - ((Ca2+)+(Mg2+))\nWhere concentrations are in meq/L.\n\nRSC less than 1.25 is **safe**\nRSC between 1.25 and 2.50 is **marginal**\nRSC greater than 2.50 is **unsuitable**\n\n**Use of ground water for livestock and poultry**\n\nTDS &lt; 1000 mg/L -- Excellent -- Excellent for all classes of livestock and poultry.\n\nTDS b/w 1000-3000 -- very satisfactory -- Satisfactory for all classes of livestock. May cause temporary mild diarrhea in livestock not accustomed to them. Those waters approaching the upper limits may cause some watery droppings in poultry.\n\nTDS b/w 3000-5000 -- Satisfactory for livestock Unfit for poultry -- Satisfactory for livestock but may be refused by animals not accustomed to it. If Sulphate salts predominate, animals may show temporary diarrhea. Poor waters for poultry, often causing watery faeces, increased mortality and decreasedgrowth especially in turkeys. \n\nTDS b/w 5000-7000 -- Limited use for livestock Unfit for poultry -- This water can be used for livestock except for those that are pregnant or lactating. It may have some laxative effect and may be refused by animals until they become accustomed to it. It is unsatisfactory for poultry.\n\nTDS b/w 7000-10,000 -- Very limited use -- Considerable risk for pregnant and lactating cows, horses, sheep and for the young of these species. It may be used for older ruminants or horses. Unfit for poultry and probably swine.\n\nTDS &gt; 10,000 -- Not recommended -- This water is unsatisfactory for all classes of livestock and poultry.\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/sivapriyagarladinne/telangana-post-monsoon-ground-water-quality-data	{"water bodies","earth and nature","earth science",chemistry,business,education,agriculture,"computer science",python}	{CC0-1.0}	{sno,district,mandal,village,lat_gis,long_gis,gwl,season,pH,E.C,TDS,CO3,HCO3,Cl,F,"NO3 ",SO4,Na,K,Ca,Mg,T.H,SAR,Classification,"RSC  meq  / L",Classification.1,EC,"CO_-2 ","HCO_ - ","Cl -","F -","NO3- ",SO4-2,Na+,K+,Ca+2,Mg+2,"Unnamed: 8"}	1106	79	29124	539	1

796	chemistry	Industrial data from the ladle-furnace unit	## General information\n\nLadle furnace unit (LFU) - metallurgical equipment for out-of-furnace steel processing in the converter shop. The LFU is a large metal ladle with a volume of about 100 tons and is lined from the inside with refractory bricks. Molten steel is poured into the LFU from a steel ladle and then heated by graphite electrodes inserted into the unit's lid.\n\nIn addition to electric heating, desulfurization (removal of sulfur from the melt), adjustment of the chemical composition, and sampling are carried out at the CPC. Alloying of metal is carried out both with lumpy ferroalloys through the system to supply **bulk** materials from bunkers and with **wire** materials through a tube apparatus. Averaging the chemical composition and temperature is carried out through the bottom purge device in the steel ladle.\n\nAfter completion of processing at the LFU, the melt is poured back into the steel ladle and either sent to other metal finishing units or to a continuous casting plant, where it solidifies in the form of metallurgical slabs.\n\n## Content\n\nEach time the melt enters the Ladle Furnace Unit, the initial temperature and chemical composition are measured. Then, if necessary, the melt is heated for several minutes, after which alloying materials are added, purged with a gas, stirring the melt, and measurements are again carried out following the approved Technological Instruction. This cycle is repeated several times until the target chemistry and melting temperature are reached. In this case, it is not necessary that the melt would be heated in each cycle.\n\nThe given datasets provide information on the main technological operations performed at the Ladle Furnace Unit (such as heating, ferroalloy output, chemistry measurement, etc.) with a time reference.\n\n## Files\n\n- `data_gas.csv` - the file with supplied gases for purging\n- `data_bulk.csv` - the file with the given bulk elements\n- `data_bulk_time.csv` - the file with the time of bulk delivery\n- `data_wire.csv` - the file with wire supply\n- `data_wire_time.csv` - the file with wire recoil time\n- `data_arc.csv` - the file with information on the supplied electricity\n- `data_temp.csv` - the file with temperature measurements\n\nThe latter file is missing part of the temperature measurements. \n\n- `data_temp_FULL_with_test.csv` with the test sample\n\n*There is no information about the decoding of the **wire** and **bulk** parameters.*\n\n##The main problem \nTemperature forecasting: it is required to build a model that will predict what temperature measurements were at these points in time.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/yuriykatser/industrial-data-from-the-ladlefurnace-unit	{"earth and nature",business,manufacturing,"time series analysis",tabular,regression}	{CC0-1.0}	{key,"Heating start","Heating end","Active power","Reactive power","Bulk 1","Bulk 2","Bulk 3","Bulk 4","Bulk 5","Bulk 6","Bulk 7","Bulk 8","Bulk 9","Bulk 10","Bulk 11","Bulk 12","Bulk 13","Bulk 14","Bulk 15","Gas 1",time,Temperature,"Wire 1","Wire 2","Wire 3","Wire 4","Wire 5","Wire 6","Wire 7","Wire 8","Wire 9"}	62349	65	338048	121223	1

798	chemistry	Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis	This dataset can be used to predict the presence of kidney stones based on urine analysis. \n\nThe 79 urine specimens, were analyzed in an effort to\ndetermine if certain physical characteristics of the urine might be related to the\nformation of calcium oxalate crystals.\nThe six physical characteristics of the urine are: (1) specific gravity, the density of the urine relative to water; (2) pH, the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion; (3) osmolarity (mOsm), a unit used in biology and medicine but not in\nphysical chemistry. Osmolarity is proportional to the concentration of\nmolecules in solution; (4) conductivity (mMho milliMho). One Mho is one\nreciprocal Ohm. Conductivity is proportional to the concentration of charged\nions in solution; (5) urea concentration in millimoles per litre; and (6) calcium\nconcentration (CALC) in millimolesllitre.\n\nThe data is obtained from 'Physical Characteristics of Urines With and Without Crystals',a chapter from Springer Series in Statistics.\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-5098-2_45	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/kidney-stone-prediction-based-on-urine-analysis	{health}	{unknown}	{gravity,ph,osmo,cond,urea,calc,target}	79	7	553	0	0.8823529411764706
799	chemistry	Measurements of urine pH	### Context\n\nUrine comprises water, salts, and waste products from the kidneys. The balance of these compounds can affect the urine's acidity levels, which specialists measure in pH. According to the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, the average value for urine pH is 6.0, but it can range from 4.5 to 8.0. Urine under 5.0 is acidic, and urine higher than 8.0 is alkaline, or basic. Different laboratories may have different ranges for "normal" pH levels. The laboratory report will explain the normal and abnormal levels for the specific laboratory.\n\nIf a person has a high urine pH, meaning that it is more alkaline, it might signal a medical condition such as: kidney stones, urinary tract infections (UTIs), kidney-related disorders.\n\nIf a person has low urine pH, meaning that it is more acidic, it might indicate a medical condition such as: diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a complication of diabetes, diarrhea, starvation. Acidic urine can also create an environment where kidney stones can form. \n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset is formed by a single 60 years old man, which is diagnosed with initial stage of kidney stones. Doctor recommended to keep pH level on average level (pH: 6.4 - 6.8) to stop forming of new stones and drink more water to get rid of already formed stones. pH level was measured with "PH-02" device (Measuring range: 0.0 - 14.0 pH, Measurement accuracy: ± 0.1 pH). Measurements of pH were made on everyday basis almost without erros or misses on track. With pH measurements all the food (and some other conditions like gym) were accurately logged. Dataset consist of 2 parts.\n\nFirst part was logged from 06.09.2017 to 05.04.2018 on daily basis. e.g. no exact time of pH measurements or time of eating were recorded. Only day is available. File: ph_v1_days.csv\n\nSecond part logged from from 09.04.2018 to 25.09.2018 with exact time of day when measurement was made. Files: prods.csv and phlist.csv\n\n### Inspiration\n\nPredict what combination of products is best to eat to keep pH on average level (6.4 - 6.8), which is recommended to prevent kidney stones.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/zfturbo/measurements-of-urine-ph	{healthcare,diseases,health,medicine}	{unknown}	{PH,time,date,Date,PH_morning,PH_midday,PH_evening,PH_avg,Ailment,Gym,Liquid,"Lemon water",Tea(black/green),"Fruit tea",Water,Latte,"Mineral water (Esentuki - 4)","Mineral water (Borjomi)","Mineral water (Prolom)",Tequila,"Red wine","White wine","Strong alcohol",Beer,Morse,Milk,"Orange juice",Oatmeal,"Pizza with meat","Cheese Pizza",Cheesecakes,"Scrambled eggs","Mayonnaise salad",Bread,Meat,Sauce,Cutlet,Sausage,Fish,Sushi,"Cod liver",Cheese,Curd,"Sour cream","Buckwheat porridge","Noodles with vegetables","Noodles with shrimp","Meat pilaf","Meatless pilaf","Pea soup with meat","Fried vegetables","Pyagse with vegetables","Dumplings with cabbage","Potato dumplings","Zucchini Fritters","Stewed cabbage","Solyanka with meat","Eggplant with cheese",Pasta,"Fried potatoes","Cooked Potatoes","Braised Potatoes","Mashed potatoes","Apple Pie","Patty with cabbage","Curd Pie","Cheese Pie","Egg Pie","Potato pie","Meat pie",Khachapuri,"The nuts","Pumpkin seeds",Raisins,"Dried apricots","Vegetable salad","Eggplant caviar","The vinaigrette",Apple,Peach,Melon,Plum,Tangerines,Pear,Watermelon,Banana,Grapes,Pineapple,Orange,Paste,Kumquat,"Ice cream",Cookie,Cake,Bun,Croissant,Chocolate,Candies,Halva,Marshmallow,"Red caviar",Jelly,Product,Weight,Time}	5424	106	40464	16458	0.47058823529411764

An additional column is included for majority element for each alloy, which can be an interesting property to group on during tests.\n\n\n### Content\n\n        X features:\n\t\tThe metallic glass dataset gives two columns with information about the material\n\t\tComposition. The first is the overall composition, and the second is the highest\n\t\tComposition element. The columns from four to the end are the MAGPIE features that\n\t\thave been generated from the material composition column and give values such as\n\t\tproperties averaged over the material composition as well as features that are only for \n\t\tthe majority element in each alloy [3]. The majority element features are labelled as \n\t\t"site1".\n\t\t\n\tY property:\n\t\tThe reduced glass transition temperature (Trg) has historically been used as a rough \n\t\tpredictor for Glass Forming Ability (GFA). By making a model to predict Trg for an \n\t\tarbitrary alloy, it could be possible to use these values to estimate GFA directly, or as \n\t\tinput for another model to then predict GFA.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMorgan, Dane (2018): Machine Learning Materials Datasets. figshare.

808	chemistry	Multivariate Geochemical classification	### Context\n\nThe Bushveld Complex, the largest layered mafic-ultramafic intrusion worldwide, is host of numerous, laterally continuous and chemically similar chromitite layers. Based on their stratigraphic position the layers are subdivided into a lower, middle and upper group (LG, MG and UG). Within these groups the layers are numbered successively – from the base to the top of each group. Attempts of discriminating between single layers based on their composition have failed – mainly due to the significant overlap of compositional fields, e.g. of chromitite mineral assemblages and chromite mineral chemistry between (neighboured) layers. In this contribution a tailored and easy to use multivariate classification scheme for the chromitite layers is proposed, based on a comprehensive classification routine for the LG and MG chromitites. This routine allows a clear attribution with known uncertainty of eight distinct chromitite layers. The study was carried out at the Thaba Mine, a chromite mine located on the western limb of the Bushveld Complex. The classification is based on a large geochemical database (N = 1205) from Thaba Mine. It comprises of a hierarchical discrimination approach relying on linear discriminant analysis and involves five distinct steps. Using default homogeneous prior probabilities, classification results are excellent for the first discrimination steps (LGs vs. MGs, 97 %; LG-6 vs. LG-6A, 94 %) and very good for the following steps (MG-1/2 vs. MG-3/4, 86 %; MG-1 vs. MG-2, 92 %; MG-3 vs. MG-4, 93 %; MG-4 vs. MG-4Z, 97 %; MG-4 vs. MG-4A, 88 %). The classification scheme was tested using the same sample set as a training set with unknown composition. Overall classification results for unknown samples belonging to one of the layers are 81 %. Hence, the classification scheme is at least valid for the Thaba mine. The approach may, however, be extended across the entire Bushveld, provided that an appropriate geochemical data set is available.\ntext source - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0883292719300435?via%3Dihub\n\n### Content\n\nMajor Elements and PGE concentrations of LG and MG chromitites\n\nPaper - https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.02.009\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nBachmann, Kai (2019), “Data for: Multivariate geochemical classification of chromitite seams in the Bushveld Complex, South Africa”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/dc8jcnbcvk.1\n\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/multivariate-geochemical-classification	{geology,classification}	{"Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)"}	{ProjectCode;BH_ID;Motherhole;HoleType;MaxDepth;DepthFrom;DepthTo;Date;Cr2O3_%;FeO_%;SiO2_%;MgO_%;Al2O3_%;CaO_%;P_%;Au_ICP_ppm;Pt_ICP_ppm;Pd_ICP_ppm;Rh_ICP_ppm;Ir_ICP_ppm;Ru_ICP_ppm;Stratigraphy;Filter}	1205	1	1205	0	0.9411764705882353

812	chemistry	Nobel prize from 1901 till 2020	### Context\n\nThe Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances. The will of the Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist Alfred Nobel established the five Nobel prizes in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901. The prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards available in their respective fields.\n\nBetween 1901 and 2020, the Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded to 949 people . The Nobel Prize is an international award administered by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden, and based on the fortune of Alfred Nobel, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. Each Prize consists of a medal, a personal diploma, and a cash award.\n\nA person or organization awarded the Nobel Prize is called Nobel Laureate. The word "laureate" refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honor.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset includes a record for every individual that was awarded the Nobel Prize since 1901.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis dataset is available on [Nobel prize api](https://nobelprize.readme.io/docs).\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWhich country has won the most prizes in each category? 	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/bahramjannesarr/nobel-prize-from-1901-till-2020	{history,"computer science","data visualization"}	{ODbL-1.0}	{firstname,surname,born_country_code,died_country_code,gender,year,category,share,name_of_university,city_of_university,country_of_university,born_month,age,age_get_prize}	923	14	12922	995	1

They are adopted from the MoleculeNet [1], and are among the largest of the MoleculeNet datasets. All the molecules are pre-processed using RDKit [2]. Each graph represents a molecule, where nodes are atoms, and edges are chemical bonds. Input node features are 9-dimensional, containing atomic number and chirality, as well as other additional atom features such as formal charge and whether the atom is in the ring or not. The full description of the features is provided in [code](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/blob/master/ogb/utils/features.py). The script to convert the SMILES string [3] to the above graph object can be found [here](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/blob/master/examples/graphproppred/mol/smiles2graph.py). Note that the script requires [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html) to be installed. The script can be used to pre-process external molecule datasets so that those datasets share the same input feature space as the OGB molecule datasets. This is particularly useful for pre-training graph models, which has great potential to significantly increase generalization performance on the (*downstream*) OGB datasets [4].\n\nBeside the two main datasets, the dataset authors additionally provide 10 smaller datasets from MoleculeNet. They are `ogbg-moltox21`, `ogbg-molbace`, `ogbg-molbbbp`, `ogbg-molclintox`, `ogbg-molmuv`, `ogbg-molsider`, and `ogbg-moltoxcast` for (multi-task) binary classification, and `ogbg-molesol`, `ogbg-molfreesolv`, and `ogbg-mollipo` for regression. Evaluators are also provided for these datasets. These datasets can be used to stress-test molecule-specific methods or transfer learning [4].\n\nFor encoding these raw input features, the dataset authors prepare simple modules called `AtomEncoder` and `BondEncoder`. They can be used as follows to embed raw atom and bond features to obtain `atom_emb` and `bond_emb`.\n\n```py\nfrom ogb.graphproppred.mol_encoder import AtomEncoder, BondEncoder\natom_encoder = AtomEncoder(emb_dim = 100)\nbond_encoder = BondEncoder(emb_dim = 100)\n\natom_emb = atom_encoder(x) # x is the input atom feature\nedge_emb = bond_encoder(edge_attr) # edge_attr is the input edge feature\n```\n\n**Prediction task:** The task is to predict the target molecular properties as accurately as possible, where the molecular properties are cast as binary labels, e.g, whether a molecule inhibits HIV virus replication or not. Note that some datasets (e.g., `ogbg-molpcba`) can have multiple tasks, and can contain `nan` that indicates the corresponding label is not assigned to the molecule. For evaluation metric, the dataset authors closely follow [2]. Specifically, for `ogbg-molhiv`, the dataset authors use ROC-AUC for evaluation. For `ogbg-molpcba`, as the class balance is extremely skewed (only 1.4% of data is positive) and the dataset contains multiple classification tasks, the dataset authors use the Average Precision (AP) averaged over the tasks as the evaluation metric.\n\n**Dataset splitting:** The dataset authors adopt the *scaffold splitting* procedure that splits the molecules based on their two-dimensional structural frameworks. The scaffold splitting attempts to separate structurally different molecules into different subsets, which provides a more realistic estimate of model performance in prospective experimental settings [1].\n\n### License: MIT License\n\n### Open Graph Benchmark\n\n**Website:** https://ogb.stanford.edu\n\nThe Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) [5] is a collection of realistic, large-scale, and diverse benchmark datasets for machine learning on graphs. OGB datasets are automatically downloaded, processed, and split using the OGB Data Loader. The model performance can be evaluated using the OGB Evaluator in a unified manner.\n\n### References\n\n[1] Zhenqin Wu, Bharath Ramsundar, Evan N Feinberg, Joseph Gomes, Caleb Geniesse, Aneesh SPappu, Karl Leswing, and Vijay Pande.

820	chemistry	Periodic Table with 28 Features	The periodic table is the systematic and tabular arrangement of all known chemical elements in which elements having similar properties kept together. In the table, the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number of one, hydrogen. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in that particular nucleus of an atom. In the periodic table the elements are arranged into periods and groups. A row of elements across the table is called a period. Each period has a number; from 1 to 8. Period 1 has only 2 elements in it: hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements. Other periods are longer. Elements in a period have consecutive atomic numbers.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/psycon/periodic	{chemistry}	{CC0-1.0}	{AtomicNumber,Element,Symbol,AtomicMass,NumberofNeutrons,NumberofProtons,NumberofElectrons,Period,Group,Phase,Radioactive,Natural,Metal,Nonmetal,Metalloid,Type,AtomicRadius,Electronegativity,FirstIonization,Density,MeltingPoint,BoilingPoint,NumberOfIsotopes,Discoverer,Year,SpecificHeat,NumberofShells,NumberofValence}	118	28	3304	636	1

It contains 30 variables known as descriptors that measure the structure and activity of a molecule in order to accurately predict its activation energy. \n> \n> This data provides valuable insights into relationships between a molecule's composition and its reactivity, making it applicable for various activities such as drug design. Furthermore, this dataset encourages further research towards understanding how chemical compounds interact and how changes to a molecule's structure can affect its ability to interact with other molecules. \n> \n> The descriptors used in this dataset are: SpMax_L, J_Dz(e), nHM, F01[N-N], F04[C-N], NssssC, nCb-, C%, nCp, nO, F03[C-N], SdssC, HyWi_B(m), LOC SM6_L ,F03[C-O], Me , Mi ,nN-N , nArNO2 ,nCRX3 ,SpPosA_B(p) ,nCIR B01[ -Br ], B03 [ C -Cl ], N –073,-026 SpMax _ A Psi i 1dB04 [ C -Br ], SdO TI2 L NO rt c O02a dH DonSpmax _ B mP s i A N SM6 BM Arco or NX Class .Using these feature vectors along with labels for the test rows in the data set, predictive models can be built to evaluate the accuracy of predicting molecule activation energies for future applications\n\n### More Datasets\n> For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n> - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n> This dataset can be used to explore the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of molecules and their properties. The data includes 30 variables, or descriptors, that can be used to predict the activation energy of a molecule. By accurately predicting the activation energy, researchers can better understand how changes to a molecule's structure affect its reactivity and ability to interact with other molecules. \n> \n> To get started with this dataset, first download it from Kaggle or clone this repository . After downloading the data set , you will need to import it into your preferred software as a CSV file . Make sure that all variables are properly labelled and categorized . Once your data has been imported , you should visualize certain molecuar factors by plotting various scatter plots or histograms . This will allow you to gain better insights into the relationships between different descriptor variables, as well as any outliers within your dataset.  \n>  \n> Next , select a machine learning algorithm that best suits your objectives and fits reasonably within computational resources available in order for you create an effective predictive model. You may need several iterations before finding an optimal algorithm(s) for this purpose, including assessing whether they generalize well outside of training data sets based on accuracy levels achieved on test datasets supplied in parallel with original set through by Kaggle - file test_rows & test_rows_labels. The last step is then constructing cross-validation strategy which requires 5 0r 10 fold CV tests at least before measuring performance metrics & generating preliminary results correspondingly (including reporting any possible overfitting). Lastly generate report & present findings where needed (depending on outcomes & resulting recommendations )\n\n### Research Ideas\n> - Developing novel predictive models for predicting activation energies of molecules and their properties, such as reactivity or solubility, by combining statistical methods such as regression with machine learning techniques like deep learning. \n> - Developing methods for exploring patterns between molecules with known properties and those with unknowns using unsupervised ML algorithms like hierarchical clustering. \n> - Identifying correlations between molecular descriptors and activity using exploratory data analysis techniques to form hypotheses that can be used to choose which compounds to synthesize in further studies into the structure-activity relationships of compounds\n\n### Acknowledgements\n> If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n> [Data Source](https://zenodo.org/record/3738729#.Y9ZANNJBwUE)\n> \n>\n\n\n### License\n> \n> \n> **License: [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)**\n> No Copyright - You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

This has also caused the appearance of what seem to be duplicate observations. There are no duplicates though, so avoid trying to remove duplicates.\n\n## About the Data\nThe data was collected on November 13th, 2019 by students in the Monday/Wednesday Fall 2019 class of the Marine Biology Laboratory (SIO 136) at Scripps Institute of Oceanography (UCSD). This course is part of the Marine Biology Bachelor of Science program. The instructor for this part of the course was Dovi Kacev (dkacev@ucsd.edu). The person sharing this data (me) was a student in this course.\n\nThe data is a survey of several organisms (see Table 1) in a Rocky Intertidal Zone (see further details about this below). The Rocky Intertidal Zone surveyed was a section of Dike Rock, Scripps Coastal Reserve in La Jolla, CA which “is characterized by many large boulders in the high intertidal, broad mud and sandstone benches covered with coralline algal turf in the mid-intertidal, and a mixture of larger boulders and algae-covered flats in the lower intertidal area” and is a site that has been monitored by LiMPETS since 2007. (1) \n\n*Table 2:* The target species surveyed for each group type\n| Group Type | Target Species |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sessile Benthic Invertebrates | Acorn Barnacles, Goose Neck Barnacles, Sea Anemones, Mussels |\n| Small Mobile Invertebrates | Hermit Crabs, Chitons, Snails, Limpets |\n| Large Mobile Invertebrates | Seahares and Nudibranches, Seastars, Crabs, Cucumbers, Octopus |\n\n## Rocky Intertidal Zone\nThe rocky intertidal zone is an ecosystem found between the low and high tides of rocky beaches. This ecosystem has extreme conditions including desiccation (extreme drying), extreme temperature changes, and being pounded by waves. However, it can also be an optimal place to live for those that can endure the harsh conditions due to having access to a lot of light, nutrients, and oxygen. (2,3) The high intertidal zone is only covered in water during high tide and has species including acorn barnacles, snails, limpets, and shore crabs. The middle intertidal zone is partially covered in water and partially exposed to the air during the day and has species including hermit crabs, chitons, gooseneck barnacles, mussels, aggregating anemones, and some seastars. The low intertidal zone is only exposed during low tides and has species including green anemones, seahares and nudibranchs, cucumbers, and some seastars. Occasionally, octopi will also come into the zone for food. (3-6)\n\nThere are several abiotic and biotic factors at play in the rocky intertidal zone that can affect the ecology of the species living there and each species is affected differently. Abiotic factors are nonliving things that can affect the living organisms such as desiccation. Some organisms can withstand this drying out and so have the ability to live in the higher tidal zones where other organisms would not. However, closer to the shore comes salinity stress and wave action. Biotic factors are living things or processes that affect other organisms such as competition. Competition is one of the biggest biotic factors in the rocky intertidal zone. The abundance of plant material, such as algae and settled juvenile shellfish, can be a biotic factor for small mobile invertebrates because they have to fight with others for the same food source. Small mobile invertebrates also have to deal with predators such as starfish and crabs.

831	chemistry	Secchi Depth	A Secchi disk is a circular disk with alternating black and white quadrants that is used to measure the clarity or transparency of water. It is typically lowered into the water using a line, and the depth at which it disappears from view is measured. The depth at which the disk disappears is called the "Secchi depth" and it provides an indication of the water clarity.\n\nMeasuring water transparency is important for a few reasons. First, it can indicate the health of aquatic ecosystems. Clear water allows sunlight to penetrate deeper, which is important for photosynthesis by aquatic plants and algae. If the water becomes cloudy or turbid, it can indicate that there is too much sediment or other particles in the water, which can have negative impacts on the ecosystem.\n\nSecond, water transparency can also impact water quality for human use. For example, if the water is too turbid, it can make it difficult to treat for drinking water or for use in industrial processes. Additionally, if the water is too cloudy or turbid, it can impact recreational uses such as swimming or fishing.\n\nOverall, measuring water transparency using a Secchi disk can provide important information about the health and quality of aquatic ecosystems, as well as the suitability of water for human use.\n\nThis dataset is sampled from 135 locations along the eastern coast of Georgian Bay in Ontario, Canada from 2003-2005. It provides data on the Secchi depth alongside the characteristics of the water.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F6247135%2F33db54e2761af367ead97b0aa070190f%2Fsecchi_demonstration.jpeg?generation=1679696033632439&alt=media)	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/jacobsharples/secchi-depth	{"water bodies","earth and nature",environment,tabular,canada}	{CC0-1.0}	{ï»¿secchi,date,depth,alkalinity,calcium,chlorophyll_a_corrected,chlorophyll_a_total,chlorophyll_b_total,chloride,color,conductivity_25,conductivity_estimate,carbon_inorganic,carbon_organic,hardness,potassium,magnesium,sodium,ammonium,nitrite,nitrates_total,nitrogen,ph,phosphate,phosphorus_unfiltered,phosphorus_total,residue,silicates,sulphate,turbidity}	404	30	12120	96	1

837	chemistry	Synchrotron Data Set	### Summary\n\nThe reduction of pollutants such as inorganic metals is an important environmental chemical reaction. This proposal focuses on the reduction of chromate(Cr(VI)) using zerovalent iron(Fe0) as a solid phase remediation material. Numerous studies have investigated Cr(VI) reactions with Fe0 but there remains significant outstanding questions about the mechanism of reduction and the products formed on the surface of the corroded Fe0. In addition, Fe0 creates reactive surfaces and solid Fe(II)/Fe(III) hydroxide products with high surface areas that have proven difficult to quantify. The overall goal of this proposal is to combine [Surface Data Analysis-cue why ]X-ray spectroscopy with electron microscopy imaging to identify and quantify the Cr reaction products and to develop 3D stereoscopic model for measuring surface area based on SEM images. It is expected that the proposed research will result in an improved approach to analyzing the morphology and specific surface area of complex materials. \n\n\n### Background\n\nThe reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by Fe0 has been studied using several analytical techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy(EXAFS), X-ray diffraction(XRD) and scanning electron microscopy(SEM). Using these techniques it has been determined that the reduction of Cr(VI) is coupled with the oxidation of Fe0\n\nFe˚  Fe3+ + 3e-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(1)\nCrO42- + 3e- + 8 H+  Cr3+ +4H2O\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2)\n------------------------------------------- \nNet equation : CrO42- + Fe˚+ 8 H+  Cr3+ +Fe3+ + 4H2O\t\t\t\t(3)\n\nAn additional reaction includes the adsorption and co-precipitation of Cr(III) by Fe(III) oxide surface \n\nFe3+ +Cr3+ + 3OH-  (Fe, Cr)(OH)3(s)\t\t\t\t\t\t(4)\n\nThe reaction forms a mixed Fe(III)/Cr(III) hydroxide solid that is insoluble and effectively removes Cr(VI) from solution. The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) also decreases the toxicity by converting the toxic Cr(VI) form to the insoluble, non-toxic Cr(III) hydroxide form.\nZerovalent iron surfaces oxidize in water and produce Fe(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH3)) which generates reactive surface for adsorption of pollutants. The Fe0 solid particles oxidize and produce an oxide growth shell around the Fe0 core making a “core-shell” solid structure. This structure has been studied using transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and a typical image of oxidized Fe0\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThanks to Drs Manning and Skalars and NIC Granted\n\n\n###Goals and objectives\n\nGoals and objectives\nMore detailed information is needed about the Fe oxide/hydroxide core-shell structure and the specific surface area of complex surface features. The overall goal of this proposl is to use Cr(VI) as a model pollutant to study the surface structures and surface area measurement by a new approach using SEM imaging. The specific objectives of the proposal are: \n\n\t•\tInvestigate the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by Fe0 using XPS;\n\t•\tUse XAS (EXAFS and XANES) to provide structural information ( inter-atomic distances and coordination shell) about the Fe/Cr products;\n\t•\tUse SEM to develop images of Fe0 oxides and Cr(VI)-treated Fe(0) to define the effects of Cr(V) treatment on the morphology of the Fe oxide/hydroxide crystals;\n\t•\tDevelop the application of a computer software approach to calculating the specific surface area of complex Fe0 oxidation products. \n\t•\tPromote internal database combined with X-ray beam line such SSRL.

840	chemistry	The Complete List of Nobel Prize Winners	**# The Complete Lists of Nobel Prize Winners**\n\n\n**About Nobel Prize :**\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are five separate prizes that, according to Alfred Nobel's will of 1895, are awarded to "those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind." Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist most famously known for the invention of dynamite.\n\nAlfred Nobel (listen (help·info)) was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of engineers. He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. In 1894, Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder cordite. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime.\n\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/rajkumarpandey02/the-complete-list-of-nobel-prize-winners	{"exploratory data analysis","data analytics",tabular,pandas,python}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Unnamed: 0",Year,Name,Name.1,Gender,Citizenship,"Second Citizenship",Born,Remarks,"Affiliation at the time of the award","CitizenshiporHeadquarters Location",BornorEstablished}	765	48	7308	1417	0.9411764705882353
847	chemistry	Wine Quality Dataset	### Dataset Information:\n\nThe dataset contains physico-chemical properties related to red variant of wine. The output variable predicts the quality of wine.\n\nThis dataset can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced. The outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the wines which might be excellent or poor quality. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.\n\n### Attribute Information:\n\n**Input variables** (based on physicochemical tests):\n1 - fixed acidity\n2 - volatile acidity\n3 - citric acid\n4 - residual sugar\n5 - chlorides\n6 - free sulfur dioxide\n7 - total sulfur dioxide\n8 - density\n9 - pH\n10 - sulphates\n11 - alcohol\n**Output variable** (based on sensory data):\n12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)\n\n\n### Acknowledgements:\n\nP.

849	chemistry	Young People Survey	# Introduction\n\nIn 2013, students of the Statistics class at [FSEV\nUK](https://fses.uniba.sk/en/) were asked to invite their friends to\nparticipate in this survey.\n\n* The data file (`responses.csv`) consists of 1010 rows and 150 columns (139\ninteger and 11 categorical).\n* For convenience, the original variable names were shortened in the\ndata file. See the `columns.csv` file if you want to match the data with the original names.\n* The data contain missing values.\n* The survey was presented to participants in both electronic and written form.\n* The original questionnaire was in Slovak language and was later translated\ninto English.\n* All participants were of Slovakian nationality, aged between 15-30.\n\nThe variables can be split into the following groups:\n\n* **Music preferences** (19 items)\n* **Movie preferences** (12 items)\n* **Hobbies & interests** (32 items)\n* **Phobias** (10 items)\n* **Health habits** (3 items)\n* **Personality traits, views on life, & opinions** (57 items)\n* **Spending habits** (7 items)\n* **Demographics** (10 items)\n\n# Research questions\n\nMany different techniques can be used to answer many questions, e.g.\n\n* **Clustering:** Given the music preferences, do people make up\nany clusters of similar behavior?\n* **Hypothesis testing:** Do women fear certain phenomena\nsignificantly more than men? Do the left handed people have different\ninterests than right handed?\n* **Predictive modeling:** Can we predict spending habits of a person\nfrom his/her interests and movie or music preferences?\n* **Dimension reduction:** Can we describe a large number of human\ninterests by a smaller number of latent concepts?\n* **Correlation analysis:** Are there any connections between music and\nmovie preferences?\n* **Visualization:** How to effectively visualize a lot of variables\nin order to gain some meaningful insights from the data?\n* **(Multivariate) Outlier detection:** Small number of participants often cheats and randomly answers the questions. Can you identify them? Hint: [Local outlier factor][1] may help.\n* **Missing values analysis:** Are there any patterns in missing responses? What is the optimal way of imputing the values in surveys?\n* **Recommendations:** If some of user's interests are known, can we predict the other? Or, if we know what a person listen, can we predict which kind of movies he/she might like?\n\n# Past research\n\n* (in slovak) Sleziak, P. - Sabo, M.: Gender differences in the prevalence of specific phobias.

856	entertainment	Animal Welfare	**Introduction**\n\nAnimal welfare is important because there are so many animals around the world suffering from being used for entertainment, food, medicine, fashion, scientific advancement, and as exotic pets. Every animal deserves to have a good life where they enjoy the benefits of the Five Domains.\n\n**About Dataset**\n\nWe aim to reduce total suffering, society’s ability to reduce this in other animals – which feel pain, too – also matters.\n\nThis is especially true when we look at the numbers: every year, humans slaughter more than 80 billion land-based animals for farming alone. Most of these animals are raised in factory farms, often in painful and inhumane conditions.\n\nEstimates for fish are more uncertain, but when we include them, these numbers more than double.\n\nThese numbers are large – but this also means that there are large opportunities to alleviate animal suffering by reducing the number of animals we use for food, science, cosmetics, and other industries and improving the living conditions of those we continue to raise.\n\nOn this page, you can find all of our data, and writing on animal welfare.\n\nFile 1:\nThe estimated number of animal lives that go toward each kilogram of animal product purchased for retail sale, including direct deaths only. For example, the pork numbers include only the deaths of pigs slaughtered for food.\n\nFile 2:\nThe estimated number of animal lives that go toward each kilogram of animal product purchased for retail sale, including direct and indirect deaths. For example, the pork numbers include the deaths of pigs slaughtered for food (direct) but also those who die pre-slaughter and feed fish given to those pigs (indirect).\n\nFile 3:\nThe estimated quantity of edible meat produced per animal, measured in kilograms.\n\nFile 4:\nDifferent location on time span = 2013 - 2020\n\nFile 5:\nShare of hens in cages\nShare of hens housed in a barn or aviary\nShare of non-organic, free-range hens\nShare of organic, free-range hens\nShare of laying hens in unknown housing \n\nFile 6: \nNumber of eggs from hens in organic, free-range farms\nNumber of eggs from hens in non-organic, free-range farms\nNumber of eggs from hens in barns\nNumber of eggs from hens in (enriched) cages\n\nFile 7:\nEstimated number of farmed decapod crustaceans\nEstimated number of farmed decapod crustaceans (upper bound)\nEstimated number of decapod crustaceans (lower bound)\n\nFile 8:\nEstimated number of farmed fish \nEstimated number of farmed fish (upper bound) \nEstimated number of farmed fish (lower bound) \n\nFile 9:\nShare of cage-free eggs\nShare of all eggs that are produced in cage-free housing systems.

From the thought-provoking latest release of RPGs to the thrilling adventures of racing games, this database provides an insight into what constitutes as a hit game in today’s gaming industry.  Armed with this data and analysis, future developers can better understand what types of gameplay and mechanics resonate more with players to create a new gaming experience. Through its comprehensive analysis on various game titles, genres and platforms this dataset displays detailed insights into how video games can achieve global success as well as providing a wonderful window into the ever-changing trends of gaming culture\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - 🚨 **Your notebook can be here!** 🚨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset can be used to uncover hidden trends in Global Video Games Sales. To make the most of this data, it is important to understand the different columns and their respective values.  \n&gt; \n&gt; The 'Rank' column identifies each game's ranking according to its global sales (highest to lowest). This can help you identify which games are most popular globally. \n&gt; The 'Game Title' column contains the name of each video game, which allows you to easily discern one entry from another. \n&gt; The 'Platform' column lists the type of platform on which each game was released, e.g., PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so that you can make comparisons between platforms as well as specific games for each platform. \n&gt; The 'Year' column provides an additional way of making year-on-year comparisons and tracking changes over time in global video game sales.  \n&gt; In addition, this dataset also contains metadata such as genre ('Genre'), publisher ('Publisher'), and review score ('Review') that add context when considering a particular title's performance in terms of global sales rankings. For example, it might be more compelling to compare two similar genres than two disparate ones when analyzing how successful a select set of titles have been at generating revenue in comparison with others released globally within that timeline. \n&gt; Lastly but no less important are the three variables dedicated exclusively for geographic breakdowns: North America ('North America'), Europe (Europe), Japan (Japan), Rest of World (Rest of World), and Global (Global). This allows us to see how certain regions contribute individually or collectively towards a given title's overall sales figures; by comparing these metrics regionally or collectively an interesting picture arises -- from which inferences about consumer preferences and supplier priorities emerge! \n&gt; \n&gt; Overall this powerful dataset allows researchers and marketers alike a deep dive into market performance for those persistent questions about demand patterns across demographics around the world!\n\n### Research Ideas\n&gt; - Analyzing the effects of genre and platform on a game's success - By comparing different genres and platforms, one can get a better understanding of what type of games have the highest sales in different regions across the globe. This could help developers decide which type of gaming content to create in order to maximize their profits.  \n&gt; - Tracking changes in global video games trends over time - This dataset could be used to analyze how various elements such as genre or platform affect success over various years, allowing developers an inside look into what kind of videos are being favored at any given moment across the world.  \n&gt; - Identifying highly successful games and their key elements- Developers could look at this data to find any common factors such as publisher or platform shared by successful titles to uncover characteristics that lead to a high rate-of-return when creating video games or other forms media entertainment\n\n### Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the original authors.\n&gt; [Data Source](https://data.world/bramwax)\n&gt;  \n\n### License\n&gt; \n&gt; See the dataset description for more information.\n\n### Columns\n\n**File: Video Games Sales.csv**\n| Column name       | Description                                                 |\n|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Rank**          | The ranking of the game in terms of global sales.

Amid the significant growth of mobile broadband in India, Hotstar quickly became the dominant streaming service in the country.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Star India's parent company 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019, Hotstar was integrated with the company's new global streaming brand Disney+ as 'Disney+ Hotstar' in April 2020. The co-branded service added Disney+ original programming, and films and television series from its main content brands of Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and National Geographic alongside the domestic and third-party content already carried on the platform.\n\nOutside of India, the Disney+ Hotstar service also operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, which similarly combines entertainment content licensed from local, third-party studios, with the larger Disney+ library. Disney+ Hotstar is also expected to launch in the Philippines and Vietnam in the end of 2022. In Singapore, Canada, and the United Kingdom, Hotstar operates as a streaming service targeting overseas Indians, focusing on Disney Star's domestic entertainment and sports content; Disney+ operates as a standalone service in these markets. In 2021, Disney announced that it would discontinue the U.S. version of Hotstar in November 2021, in favor of adding its content to the domestic Hulu and ESPN+ services instead.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/goelyash/disney-hotstar-tv-and-movie-catalog	{"arts and entertainment","movies and tv shows",nlp,"recommender systems",tabular}	{CC-BY-SA-3.0}	{hotstar_id,title,description,genre,year,age_rating,running_time,seasons,episodes,type}	6874	10	68740	11442	1

871	entertainment	Entertainment in Saudi Arabia	The Entertainment_KSA.csv dataset contains data on various entertainment spots in Saudi Arabia. With over 500 rows of data, this dataset provides information on the name, rating, review count, genre, location, and best comment for each entertainment spot. This dataset can be used to analyze the entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia and understand the types of entertainment spots available in the country.\n\nThe way of creating datasets like Entertainment_KSA.csv is by web scraping information from public sources such as Google Maps or Yelp. Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using software tools. In this case, a web scraper would be programmed to visit the relevant pages on Google Maps or Yelp and extract information on entertainment spots such as name, rating, review count, genre, location, and best comment.\n\nThe scraped data can then be saved in a CSV file, like the Entertainment_KSA.csv dataset. Once the data is collected, it can be cleaned and processed to remove any errors or duplicates and then analyzed to gain insights into the entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs for inspiration, datasets like Entertainment_KSA.csv can be used for a variety of purposes, including market research, trend analysis, and predictive modeling. Researchers and data analysts can use this dataset to explore the types of entertainment spots available in Saudi Arabia, identify popular spots, and understand the factors that influence customer reviews and ratings.\n\nFor example, this dataset could be used to predict which new entertainment spots are likely to be successful based on their genre, location, and other factors. It could also be used to identify trends in the entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia, such as the increasing popularity of certain genres or the growth of entertainment spots in specific regions.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/anas123siddiqui/entertainment-in-saudi-arabia	{"arts and entertainment",celebrities,dance,games,travel,arabic}	{CC0-1.0}	{"Unnamed: 0",name,rating,review_count,genre,location,best_comment}	564	7	3948	277	1

All movies released since 1995 are categorized according to the following attributes: Creative type (factual, contemporary fiction, fantasy etc.), Source (book, play, original screenplay etc.), Genre (drama, horror, documentary etc.), MPAA rating, Production method (live action, digital animation etc.) and Distributor. In order to provide a fair comparison between movies released in different years, all rankings are based on ticket sales, which are calculated using average ticket prices announced by the MPAA in their annual state of the industry report.\n\n### Content\n\nThe Dataset contains various files illustrating statistics such as annual ticket sales, highest grossers each year since 1995, top grossing creative types, top grossing distributors, top grossing genres, top grossing MPAA ratings, top grossing sources, top grossing production methods and the number of wide releases each year by various distributors.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data was obtained from The Numbers website.

880	entertainment	Highest Grossing Movies	With a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.8 billion, Avatar is proclaimed to be the "highest-grossing" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and don't take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals, in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for Avatar, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America, and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide. After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20–25% of its theatrical box office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view revenues. Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights, equating to about 9% of its North American gross.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/hassanshehzadk/highest-grossing-movies	{"arts and entertainment","movies and tv shows","exploratory data analysis",tabular,text}	{CC0-1.0}	{Rank,Title,"Lifetime Gross",Year}	200	4	800	0	1

885	entertainment	HYBE sales revenue 2016-2021	HYBE Corporation, formerly known as Big Hit Entertainment, posted a total sales revenue of around 1.26 trillion South Korean won in 2021. This represents a 3,466 percent increase from 2016, when their biggest act, BTS first started rising to fame. Having started out as a small agency, HYBE is now one of the largest and most successful entertainment companies in South Korea, with several music labels under their care. This includes Big Hit Music, which manages BTS and TXT.\n\n\n\n The rise of Bangtan and HYBE \n \nHaving been the company’s only active artist for several years, the company’s finances were dependent on BTS’ success. Once BTS began receiving widespread recognition in 2016-2017, operating profits of HYBE Corporation began to rise dramatically. Thereafter, expansion into markets outside of Asia began, and HYBE achieved significant sales revenues in multiple regions outside of South Korea and Asia, as well as in online spaces. The company has utilized this success and the resulting profit to debut a new successful group, TXT, in 2019, and to diversify its products.\n\n\n\n The changing landscape of the South Korean music industry \n \nHaving risen to the top of the South Korean entertainment industry, HYBE is now competing with, and outperforming, the so-called “Big 3” . The Big 3 consist of JYP Entertainment, SM Entertainment, and YG Entertainment, three companies that have historically been successful and influential within the music industry. This group is now commonly considered to have expanded to the “Big 4”. Their place among this group was cemented with the transformation of the single Big Hit label to HYBE Corporation, which now houses Big Hit Music alongside several newly acquired entertainment companies, most prominently Pledis Entertainment. Hybe has since expanded into other entertainment-related industries, such as games and the social network Weverse.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/krystalyip/hybe-sales-revenue-20162021	{business}	{unknown}	{"ï»¿HYBE sales revenue worldwide 2016-2021","(in billion South Korean won)"}	6	2	12	0	0.5294117647058824

891	entertainment	IPL Dataset 2008-2016	**The Indian Premier League (IPL**) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India. It is one of the most popular and lucrative cricket leagues in the world. The tournament was established by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007 and is played every year during the months of March, April, and May.\n\nThe IPL follows a franchise-based model, where eight teams representing different cities or regions in India compete against each other. The teams are owned by various individuals, companies, and consortiums, including Bollywood actors, business tycoons, and corporate entities. Some of the prominent teams in the IPL include the Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings, Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nThe IPL has a star-studded lineup of players, with both international and domestic cricketers participating in the tournament. Many of the world's top cricketers, such as Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, AB de Villiers, and Chris Gayle, have been a part of the IPL. The league has provided a platform for young talents to showcase their skills and has played a significant role in the development of Indian cricket.\n\nThe tournament format involves a round-robin group stage followed by playoffs. Each team plays a total of 14 matches, facing every other team twice, once at home and once away. The top four teams in the group stage advance to the playoffs, which consist of the qualifier matches and the final. The team that finishes first in the group stage gets two chances to reach the final, while the other three teams compete in the eliminator and the second qualifier matches.\n\nThe IPL has witnessed intense rivalries, thrilling matches, and high-scoring contests over the years. The league has also been a platform for innovation in cricket, with features like strategic time-outs, cheerleaders, and the introduction of the Decision Review System (DRS) in the league before it was implemented globally.\n\nApart from the cricketing action, the IPL has become a significant entertainment spectacle, attracting a large fan base. The matches are held in various cricket stadiums across India, with fans supporting their favorite teams with enthusiasm and passion. The league has also been associated with glitz, glamour, and celebrity performances, making it a blend of sports and entertainment.\n\nThe IPL's success has led to the emergence of similar leagues in other countries, such as the Big Bash League in Australia and the Caribbean Premier League. It has also contributed to the growth of franchise-based sports leagues worldwide.\n\nOverall, the Indian Premier League has revolutionized cricket in India and has become a global phenomenon, attracting players, fans, and sponsors from around the world. It has provided a platform for top-level cricket, entertainment, and commercial opportunities, making it a highly anticipated and celebrated event in the cricket calendar.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/ipl-dataset-2008-2016	{football,cricket}	{"ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL)"}	{season,city,team1,team2,toss_winner,toss_decision,result,dl_applied,winner,win_by_runs,win_by_wickets,player_of_match,venue,umpire1,umpire2,umpire3}	577	16	9232	590	1

This data, whilst in some places incomplete, gives an unprecedented view into the experience of a single overwatch player over the course of years of gameplay. From it you can track the ups and downs, shifts in hero preference and all sorts of other exciting in game trends.\n\nThanks to JustWingIt for their amazing collecting this data.\n\nI cleaned the data a little and put it into a single CSV.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/overwatch-game-records	{games,"video games"}	{CC0-1.0}	{date,time,season,game_id,sr_start,sr_finish,sr_delta,streak_number,result,my_team_sr,enemy_team_sr,team_sr_delta,my_team_1,my_team_2,my_team_3,my_team_4,my_team_5,my_team_6,enemy_team_1,enemy_team_2,enemy_team_3,enemy_team_4,enemy_team_5,enemy_team_6,map,round,capscore,score_distance,time_left,team_role,match_length,charcter_1,character_2,character_3,communication,note,psychological_condition,eliminations,objective_kills,damage,healing,deaths,weapon_accuracy,offensive_assists,defensive_assists,scoped,"Unnamed: 46","Unnamed: 47","Unnamed: 48","Unnamed: 49"}	3299	50	164950	64511	0.7058823529411765
916	entertainment	Overwatch	Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment.  \n\nOverwatch puts players into two teams of six, with each player selecting one of several pre-defined hero characters with unique movement, attributes, and abilities; these heroes are divided into four classes: Offense, Defense, Tank and Support. Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map and/or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory poses, as they continue to play in matches. The game was launched with casual play, while Blizzard added competitive ranked play about a month after launch. Additionally, Blizzard has developed and added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards.

934	entertainment	Top Batsmen run scorers in IPL 	The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007, with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises.[9] The ICL was not recognized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the BCCI were not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board. To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in their own domestic tournaments and also imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which was considered a rebel league by the board.\n\nOn 13 September 2007, on the back of India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup, BCCI announced a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition called Indian Premier League. The first season was slated to start in April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who spearheaded the IPL effort, spelled out the details of the tournament including its format, the prize money, franchise revenue system and squad composition rules. It was also revealed that the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India players and BCCI officials and that the top two teams of the IPL would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20. Modi also clarified that they had been working on the idea for two years and that the IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL. The league's format was similar to that of the Premier League of England and the NBA in the United States.	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/surajjha101/top-batsmen-run-scorers-in-ipl	{cricket}	{CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0}	{ï»¿Rank,Player,Team,Runs,4s,6s,Mat,Innings,Highest,100s,50s,Avg,SR}	75	13	975	0	1

947	entertainment	World Happiness Report	### Context \n\nThe World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. \n\n### Content\n\nThe happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nWhat countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness? How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017 reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?\n\n**What is Dystopia?**\n\nDystopia is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables, thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive width. The lowest scores observed for the six key variables, therefore, characterize Dystopia. Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world’s lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom and least social support, it is referred to as “Dystopia,” in contrast to Utopia.\n\n**What are the residuals?**\n\nThe residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country, reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries. Figure 2.2 shows the average residual for each country when the equation in Table 2.1 is applied to average 2014- 2016 data for the six variables in that country. We combine these residuals with the estimate for life evaluations in Dystopia so that the combined bar will always have positive values. As can be seen in Figure 2.2, although some life evaluation residuals are quite large, occasionally exceeding one point on the scale from 0 to 10, they are always much smaller than the calculated value in Dystopia, where the average life is rated at 1.85 on the 0 to 10 scale.\n\n**What do the columns succeeding the Happiness Score(like Family, Generosity, etc.) describe?**\n\nThe following columns: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Trust Government Corruption describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country. \nThe Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) +  the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country as stated in the previous answer.\n\nIf you add all these factors up, you get the happiness score so it might be un-reliable to model them to predict Happiness Scores.\n\n#[Start a new kernel][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness/kernels?modal=true	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness	{"arts and entertainment","religion and belief systems","social science",economics,news}	{CC0-1.0}	{Country,Region,"Happiness Rank","Happiness Score","Standard Error","Economy (GDP per Capita)",Family,"Health (Life Expectancy)",Freedom,"Trust (Government Corruption)",Generosity,"Dystopia Residual","Lower Confidence Interval","Upper Confidence Interval",Happiness.Rank,Happiness.Score,Whisker.high,Whisker.low,Economy..GDP.per.Capita.,Health..Life.Expectancy.,Trust..Government.Corruption.,Dystopia.Residual,"Overall rank","Country or region",Score,"GDP per capita","Social support","Healthy life expectancy","Freedom to make life choices","Perceptions of corruption"}	782	55	8605	1	0.8529411764705882
