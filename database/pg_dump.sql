1	sports	Sports Car Prices dataset	This dataset contains information about the prices of different sports cars from various manufacturers. The dataset includes the make and model of the car, the year of production, the engine size, the horsepower, the torque, the 0-60 MPH time, and the price in USD. The dataset is useful for analyzing the prices of different sports cars and identifying trends in the market.\n\nColumns\n\n**1.\tCar Make:** The make of the sports car, which represents the brand or company that produced the car. Examples of car makes in this dataset include Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Audi, and McLaren.\n\n**2.\tCar Model:** The model of the sports car, which represents the specific version or variant of the car produced by the manufacturer. Examples of car models in this dataset include 911, Huracan, 488 GTB, R8, 720S, M8, AMG GT, Corvette, Mustang Shelby GT500, and GT-R Nismo.\n\n**3.\tYear:** The year of production of the sports car, which indicates the model year when the car was first introduced or made available for purchase.\n\n**4.\tEngine Size (L):** The size of the sports car's engine in liters, which represents the volume of the engine's cylinders. A larger engine size typically indicates higher power and performance. Engine sizes in this dataset range from 2.0L to 8.0L, with some cars having electric motors instead.\n\n**5.\tHorsepower:** The horsepower of the sports car, which represents the power output of the car's engine. Higher horsepower typically indicates faster acceleration and higher top speed. Horsepower values in this dataset range from 300 to 1479.\n\n**6.\tTorque (lb-ft):** The torque of the sports car in pound-feet, which represents the rotational force generated by the engine. Higher torque values typically indicate stronger acceleration and better handling. Torque values in this dataset range from 270 to 1180.\n\n**7.\t0-60 MPH Time (seconds):** The time it takes for the sports car to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour, which is a common measure of acceleration and performance. Lower 0-60 MPH times typically indicate faster acceleration and better performance. 0-60 MPH times in this dataset range from 1.85 to 5.3 seconds.\n\n**8.\tPrice (in USD):** The price of the sports car in US dollars, which represents the cost of purchasing the car. Prices in this dataset range from $25,000 to $3,000,000.\n\n** The purpose of creating this dataset is solely for educational use, and any commercial use is strictly prohibited\nand this dataset was large language models generated and not collected from actual data sources.\n\ncover image: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/357332551696985459/\n	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/sports-car-prices-dataset	{beginner,intermediate,tabular,regression,"retail and shopping"}	{"Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)"}	{"ï»¿Car Make","Car Model",Year,"Engine Size (L)",Horsepower,"Torque (lb-ft)","0-60 MPH Time (seconds)","Price (in USD)"}	1007	8	8056	13	1
2	education	Education in India	<div>\n<a href="https://link.rajanand.org/sql-challenges" target="_blank">\n<img src="https://link.rajanand.org/banner-01" alt="SQL Data Challenges" style="width: 700px; height: 120px"></a>\n</div>\n---\n\n### Context\n\nWhen India got independence from British in 1947 the literacy rate was 12.2% and as per the recent census 2011 it is 74.0%. Although it looks an accomplishment, still many people are there without access to education. \n\nIt would be interesting to know the current status of the Indian education system.\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset contains district and state wise Indian primary and secondary school education data for 2015-16.\n\nGranularity: Annual\n\nList of files: \n\n 1. 2015_16_Districtwise.csv ( 680 observations and 819 variables )\n 1. 2015_16_Statewise_Elementary.csv ( 36 observations and 816 variables )\n 1. 2015_16_Statewise_Secondary.csv ( 36 observations and 630 variables  )\n\n \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMinistry of Human Resource Development (DISE) has shared the dataset [here](http://udise.in/src.htm) and also published some [reports](http://udise.in/AR.htm).\n\nSource of Banner [image](https://unsplash.com/photos/j9jZSqfH5YI).\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThis dataset provides the complete information about primary and secondary education. There are many inferences can be made from this dataset. There are few things I would like to understand from this dataset. \n\n1. Drop out ratio in primary and secondary education. (Govt. has made law that every child under age 14 should get free compulsary education.)\n2. Various factors affecting examination results of the students.\n3. What are all the factors that makes the difference (in literacy rate) between Kerala and Bihar?\n4. What could be done to improve the female literacy rate and literacy rate in rural area?\n\n---\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://link.rajanand.org/sql-challenges" target="_blank">\n<img

3	housing	California Housing Prices	### Context\n\nThis is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.\n\nThe data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.\n  \n### Content\n\nThe data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:\n\nlongitude\n\nlatitude\n\nhousing_median_age\n\ntotal_rooms\n\ntotal_bedrooms\n\npopulation\n\nhouseholds\n\nmedian_income\n\nmedian_house_value\n\nocean_proximity\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis data was initially featured in the following paper:\nPace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry. "Sparse spatial autoregressions." Statistics & Probability Letters 33.3 (1997): 291-297.\n\nand I encountered it in 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow' by Aurélien Géron.\nAurélien Géron wrote:\nThis dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from:\n[Luís Torgo's page](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html) (University of Porto)\n\n### Inspiration\n\nSee my kernel on machine learning basics in R using this dataset, or venture over to the following link for a python based introductory tutorial: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/datasets/housing	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices	{"united states",housing,"real estate","social science","computer science",programming,software,"social issues and advocacy"}	{CC0-1.0}	{longitude,latitude,housing_median_age,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income,median_house_value,ocean_proximity}	20640	10	206400	207	0.8529411764705882
4	health	Fetal Health Classification	# Abstract\n&gt; Classify fetal health in order to prevent child and maternal mortality.\n\n# About this dataset\n&gt; ## Context\nReduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress.\nThe UN expects that by 2030, countries end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.\n\n&gt; Parallel to notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality, which accounts for **295 000 deaths** during and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). The vast majority of these deaths **(94%)** occurred in low-resource settings, and most **could have been prevented**.\n\n&gt; In light of what was mentioned above, **Cardiotocograms (CTGs)** are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n\n&gt; ## Data\nThis dataset contains **2126** records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into **3 classes**:\n- Normal\n- Suspect\n- Pathological\n\n\n# How to use\n&gt; - Create a multiclass model to classify CTG features into the three fetal health states.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\nAyres de Campos et al.

The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics to obtain 768 building shapes. The dataset comprises 768 samples and 8 features, aiming to predict two real valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nAttribute Information:\n\nThe dataset contains eight attributes (or features, denoted by X1...X8) and two responses (or outcomes, denoted by y1 and y2). The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses.\n\nSpecifically:\nX1 Relative Compactness\nX2 Surface Area\nX3 Wall Area\nX4 Roof Area\nX5 Overall Height\nX6 Orientation\nX7 Glazing Area\nX8 Glazing Area Distribution\ny1 Heating Load\ny2 Cooling Load\n\nRelevant Papers:\n\nA.

Here are more details on the methodology used for collecting and labeling the dataset (reproduced from the story):\n  \n**More on Our Methodology and Data Limitations**\n\n“Each of our raters was given a rotating selection of pages from each category on different days. In some cases, we found that pages would repost the same link or video within 24 hours, which caused Facebook to assign it the same URL. When this occurred, we did not log or rate the repeat post and instead kept the original date and rating. Each rater was given the same guide for how to review posts:\n \n* “*Mostly True*: The post and any related link or image are based on factual information and portray it accurately. This lets them interpret the event/info in their own way, so long as they do not misrepresent events, numbers, quotes, reactions, etc., or make information up. This rating does not allow for unsupported speculation or claims.\n \n* “*Mixture of True and False*: Some elements of the information are factually accurate, but some elements or claims are not. This rating should be used when speculation or unfounded claims are mixed with real events, numbers, quotes, etc., or when the headline of the link being shared makes a false claim but the text of the story is largely accurate. It should also only be used when the unsupported or false information is roughly equal to the accurate information in the post or link. Finally, use this rating for news articles that are based on unconfirmed information.    \n\n* “*Mostly False*: Most or all of the information in the post or in the link being shared is inaccurate. This should also be used when the central claim being made is false.    \n \n* “*No Factual Content*: This rating is used for posts that are pure opinion, comics, satire, or any other posts that do not make a factual claim. This is also the category to use for posts that are of the “Like this if you think...” variety.\n \n“In gathering the Facebook engagement data, the API did not return results for some posts. It did not return reaction count data for two posts, and two posts also did not return comment count data. There were 70 posts for which the API did not return share count data. We also used CrowdTangle's API to check that we had entered all posts from all nine pages on the assigned days. In some cases, the API returned URLs that were no longer active. We were unable to rate these posts and are unsure if they were subsequently removed by the pages or if the URLs were returned in error.”\n \n### Acknowledgements\n \nThis dataset was originally published on GitHub by BuzzFeed News here: https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-10-facebook-fact-check \n \n### Inspiration\n \nHere are some ideas for exploring the hyperpartisan echo chambers on Facebook:\n \n* How do left, mainstream, and right categories of Facebook pages differ in the stories they share?\n\n* Which types of stories receive the most engagement from their Facebook followers? Are videos or links more effective for engagement?\n\n* Can you replicate BuzzFeed’s findings that “the least accurate pages generated some of the highest numbers of shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook”?\n\n\n#[Start a new kernel][3]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/buzzfeed\n  [2]: https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis?utm_term=.kq9kqJDZ2#.ia1QB2KJl.\n  [3]: https://www.kaggle.com/buzzfeed/fact-checking-facebook-politics-pages/kernels?modal=true	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/mrisdal/fact-checking-facebook-politics-pages	{politics,internet,"social networks"}	{unknown}	{account_id,post_id,Category,Page,"Post URL","Date Published","Post Type",Rating,Debate,share_count,reaction_count,comment_count}	2282	12	27384	2058	0.7352941176470589

9	chemistry	Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis	This dataset can be used to predict the presence of kidney stones based on urine analysis. \n\nThe 79 urine specimens, were analyzed in an effort to\ndetermine if certain physical characteristics of the urine might be related to the\nformation of calcium oxalate crystals.\nThe six physical characteristics of the urine are: (1) specific gravity, the density of the urine relative to water; (2) pH, the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion; (3) osmolarity (mOsm), a unit used in biology and medicine but not in\nphysical chemistry. Osmolarity is proportional to the concentration of\nmolecules in solution; (4) conductivity (mMho milliMho). One Mho is one\nreciprocal Ohm. Conductivity is proportional to the concentration of charged\nions in solution; (5) urea concentration in millimoles per litre; and (6) calcium\nconcentration (CALC) in millimolesllitre.\n\nThe data is obtained from 'Physical Characteristics of Urines With and Without Crystals',a chapter from Springer Series in Statistics.\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-5098-2_45	kaggle	kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/kidney-stone-prediction-based-on-urine-analysis	{health}	{unknown}	{gravity,ph,osmo,cond,urea,calc,target}	79	7	553	0	0.8823529411764706
