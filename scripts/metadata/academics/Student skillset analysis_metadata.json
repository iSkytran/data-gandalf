    "description": "Data under analysis belongs to undergraduate students, who are pursuing bachelor's in technology. The four-year course produces a major technically sound workforce which boost up the service sector. Being a major contributor to the service sector, the students must have a technically sound skillset which can land them into companies without much struggle.\nThe skillset required as per the jobs are different as per the role, but few factors contribute to each skillset. These factors and their corelation will be studied in the research. Several hypotheses will be considered from observations of the data, which will be tested using statistical tests for rejection/non rejection.\n\nThe Team: @manasrai1406 @hellomishraa @harveernarwar @Khushiarora123 @Shivang2003 @gar414 @VIKAS_GENISYSs",
